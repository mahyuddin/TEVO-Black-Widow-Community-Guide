# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Preface

Dear BW \(Black Widow\) user. Temporary solutions, troubleshooting……and important upgrade information…for newbies…. and so called pro’s brought to you by JupaCreations.com & Doron Shalev

If you bought a TEVO Black Widow, you will find out that there is no manual for software, firmware or other electronic stuff so far.

By reading this BWCG \(Black Widow Community Guide\) from start to end, you can overcome some problems, so read this manual first fully.

If you need, for any reason, to open a support ticket for TEVO use this link:

As this document continues to grow, therefore as of revision 23 this document has been re-arranged according to chapters, paragraphs & sub-paragraphs in hierarchy of 3 levels. A TOC \(Table of Contents\) has been added, as well as revision history page.

The main chapters in this document are: Building Instructions & Videos, Operation, Mechanical, Electrical, Firmware & Software.

Please note that elements which involve conversion of energy between electricity and another entity, e.g. motion, light & heat, has been given their own chapters, i.e. ElectroMechanical, Electro-Optical & Electro-Thermal respectively.

Please note that few sections have been duplicated to streamline the reading of some topics. These are denoted in the appropriate headlines, where applicable.

An Annexes section has been added, which contains hard to find documents, as well as Glossary of terms and abbreviations. Please note that each abbreviation is explained once at the 1st appearance.

Items which require special attention are highlighted in Bold Green font.

Items which may either result in erratic operation, or pose safety issue under normal operation, are marked “Caution” and highlighted in Bold Red font.
