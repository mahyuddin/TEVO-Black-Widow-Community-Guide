**4 Building Instructions &amp; Videos**

**4.1 Video Links**

There are excellent two set of BW build videos on YouTube. Each one of these is showing the build from a different perspective. **It is strongly recommended that you watch both sets before starting to build your own**, and then follow one of them per your personal preference.

There is also an excellent series of videos, by **Thomas Sanladerer**, that each newbie should watch, as they explain the basics of 3d printing, and apply to any printer. These can be seen at [**T om’ s G ui des** .](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDJMid0lOOYnRCAdbFfzECor3EbqF8euw)

**4.2 How to square &amp; parallel the frame and leadscrews?**

The document, can be found at **Annex section 13.2** of this document.

**4.3 Gift Parts**

With your kit you receive two items as a gift. One item is a thermistor for the hot-end heat- block.

**Please note**

**This thermistor can’t be used on the heat-bed, as is, since the heat-bed uses an SMD (Surface Mount Device) type thermistor. If you need to use it for the heat-bed, refer to Section 10.2.3 for instructions.**

The other item is two LED (Light Emitting Diode)

strips which you can connect directly to the 24

VDC (Volt Direct Current) of the Power Supply Unit. If they do not work check the polarity. There have been reports that the polarity signs on the strip were wrong. So double check.

**4.4 XYZ proximity sensors adjustment (Duplicate 1 of 2)**

The X Y and Z sensors are proximity inductive sensors which sense metal. To get them working properly adjust them at a very close distance (maximum 1mm) to the part that should activate it. The sensors have a small orange LED built-in. When the sensor is activated the orange LED is ON. You can use a tip of a screw driver to test the sensor for working.

**4.5 Z bottom and top plate bearing fitting not correct (Duplicate 1 of 2)**

If you experience play on bearings, use the following tip.

Use regular thin paper and glue with a little bit of glue stick glue the piece to the outer race of the bearing and with care slide both in place.

All depends on the play. When ready remove the paper remains not needed.

If you experience such play you can use this trick temporary and file a support ticket at TEVO for a correct version.

Bearing type: MR688ZZ, ID: 8mm; OD: 16mm; Width: 4mm.

**Please note**

**Some suffixes, e.g. ZZC have 5mm width. They might fit, however this has not been verified.**

**4.6 E3D-V6 Hot-end &amp; Bowden Tube Assembly**

Assembly instructions can be found here: [**http://wiki.e3d-online.com/wiki/E3D-v6_Assembly**](http://wiki.e3d-online.com/wiki/E3D-v6_Assembly)

The Stock V3 Hot-end breakdown is as follows:

**A) Heat-sink: Modified E3D-V6.**

- The J-Head and the fins are the same as E3D-V6, however the thread for the heat-break is M6,

not M7.

**B) Heat-block: Modified E3D-V5.**

- Different dimensions. An E3D-V5 heat-block may not function properly, thermal-wise.

**C) Heat-break: Modified E3D-V5.**

- Longer by 1mm.

- Actually for 3mm filament, fited with 3mm OD, 2mm ID PTFE liner (PTFE: Poly-Tetra- Fluoro-Ethylene, known as Teflon).

**D) Nozzle: Modified MK7.**

- The nozzle is not from the E3D family.

It is recommend for anyone who has one of it’s components faulty, to do the following:

1) Get replacement parts from TEVO. Getting replacement parts from other vendors would be extremely difficult, if not impossible on one hand, and trying to use the originals/clones won’t work, as most probably they won’t fit, or not work properly thermal-wise.

2) Replace the TEVO Stock-V3 with either a genuine E3D-V6, or a good clone, as depicted in the following Figures #3 &amp; #4.

One of the most common errors, when assembling the hot-end, which is the #1 cause for leaks and clogs, is the way the nozzle is assembled with relations to the heat-block and heat-break.

The nozzle must be locked to the heat-break, not the heat-block, as depicted in Figure #2 below.

When locking the nozzle to the heat-block, a gap is formed between the nozzle and the heat-break. (**The gap is exaggerated in the figure, to enhance readability**) This gap will let the high-pressure molten filament to flow between the threads, and will start leaking at the top of the heat-block. In some cases, depending on manufacturing tolerances, it may leak from the bottom of the heat-block as well.

If the gap is large enough, the rapid temperature changes during retractions, will eventually cause it to clog.

| Figures #3 &amp; #4 show the E3D-V6 equivalents of figures #1 &amp;#2 respectively. |

**4.7 Recommended prints to start with**

Parts you might like to print to enhance the machine performance at start up.

**Your first print!**

20 mm XYZ calibration cube for checking the calibration and extrusion [**http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:214260**](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:214260)

[**http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1571664**](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1571664)

Thumbwheels

Print them in XY scale 1.05 enlarged so the 3 mm nut can be pressed in more easily.

Four 3 mm regular nuts need to be purchased.

Bed bushings to capture the springs can be found here.

[**http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1994198**](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1994198)

They also prevent the spring to carve into the bed electronic resistance tracks.

Needs four M3 nuts for upper bushings. Lower bushings do not need M3 nuts. Four 3 mm regular nuts need to be purchased.

Internal corner brackets.

[**http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1764563**](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1764563)

Outside corner bracket.

[**http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1706643**](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1706643)

Heater cooler with right hand side mounting of the original 40 mm cooler fan. Can be used with or without a BL-Touch. Uses BL-Touch with the springs that come with them by standard since Nov-2016.

4.8 **External MOSFET Mounting**

As of Mar-2017, BW control box has pre-drilled holes for mounting the external MOSFET with the supplied mounting HW, e.g. stand-offs &amp; screws.

Refer to the table below for details.

|  | **Control-Box inside view** |

|  | **Control-Box inside view** |

**5 Operation**

**5.1 Filament Change / Load Procedure**

|  | Heat your heater to 160 degrees Celsius. |
| --- | --- |
|  | Open the filament clamp fully. Pull the filament out in one pull. |
|  | Prepare the new filament so the first 5 cm are straight when it is loaded. If not uncurl it first for easier placing. |

|  | Guide the filament past the Extruder drive gear until there is friction. |
| --- | --- |
|  | Close the center clamp screw fully (2). |

**5.2 Manual Bed Leveling Procedure**

1\. Remove the glass plate if it used.

2\. Make sure the heat-bed springs are approximately equally halfway compressed on all sides.

3\. At the right hand side of the machine is the Z-min sensor placed on the vertical part.

4\. Adjust it so that the nozzle does not touch the heat-bed when you give a G28 Z command (home

Z only).

5\. Compensate for the glass plate height + 2 mm.

6\. Then place the glass plate back if used.

7\. Then home machine with G28 (home all axis).

8\. Adjust the bed screw so there is A4 paper size thickness height between heat bed and nozzle.

9\. Do this for all corners by moving the heat bed and hot-end unit by hand.

10\. When all corners are done start printing....and check with a bed leveling print file if the layers are at the correct height.

**5.3 Intermittent Filament Extrusion**

|  | If the filament clamp is closed, it can hit the extruder gear unit. This can cause intermittent filament extrusion even when the pressure screws are fully turned in. |
| --- | --- |
|  | Take off (grind) the marked part of the gear unit with a file tool and refit it. |

**5.4 Machine Noise Reduction**

From the packaging you can use the black foam to put it under the four feet of the machine. To reduce it even more, you can also use it underneath the table poles. It reduces noise and vibrations.

**5.5 Hot-end Temperature Calibration**

Some filament vendors provide a temperature printing recommendation which is very wide, e.g. 190-

220C for PLA. Even if they give a single number, this is probably not accurate for the spool you are holding.

This parameter is highly variable between vendors, between different colors for the same vendor, and even between different batches of the same color and the same vendor.

Therefore it is recommended to print a temperature calibration tower, for each new spool, and note the best printing temperature on the label. This will bypass all temp related errors, such as thermistor readings, heat transfer and cooling issues of the hot-end.

For PLA, you can use the G-code given here: [**http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:656001**](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:656001)

For other materials, you should edit the G-code for the appropriate range using a text editor.

**5.6 Infill Calibration**

Test square to adjust layer height &amp; infill between closed up lines. If the infill line is higher than the neighbor lines, raise the nozzle slightly until the infill is flat.

Designed for 0.4 mm nozzle and 0.2 mm layer height.

**6 Mechanical**

**6.1 X-Axis**

**6.1.1 X-axis Leveling Easy Way**

**Tip!** To align the X-Gantry. Use two soda or beer cans as shown in the picture to make both sides level. Then tighten the appropriate screws.

**6.1.2 Wrong X Homing**

If your X-axis homes to the right you have the X belt connector placed at the bottom instead of top of the X-axis carriage.

**6.1.3 Bronze Shim Washers**

The BW manual advices to mount 1 mm bronze shim between the X-axis and the mini wheel’s

carriage. This is usually not necessary, and in many cases would lead to improper alignment of the frame. Refer to the **Parallel &amp; Square** document for proper alignment procedure.

**6.1.4 X-belt Idler Pulley –Type**

6mm GT2 Belt

Toothed idler pulley aluminum with bearing. As the belt is running in the teeth there is less ripple then with the original tooth-less idler pulleys.

**6.2 Y-Axis**

**6.2.1 Wrong Y Homing**

If your machine homes the print bed to the front 99.99% you put the belt connection at the left hand side seen from the front. The correct place is the right hand side as mentioned in the building manual.

**6.2.2 Y-belt Idler Pulley –Type**

20T

∅5mm Bore

6mm GT2 Belt

Toothed idler pulley aluminum with bearing. As the belt is running in the teeth there is less ripple then with the original tooth-less idler pulleys.

**6.2.3 Y-belt Idler Pulley – Assembly (Revised section)**

Depending on the Y-wheel assembly, and your specific kit, you may need between 2 shims (2mm) and full spacer (6mm) in order to align the Y-belt idler with the rest of the system.

If you need the wider spacing, and don’t have a suitable spacer, you may add two M5 nuts between the supplied nut and the supplied shim.

The following video shows how to do this alignment:

[**Here.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeDi3wfPslY&feature=youtu.be)

**6.3 Z-Axis**

**6.3.1 Wrong Z Homing**

If you have a new machine with the factory installed firmware and you home the machine and the

Z axis goes only up there is probably installed the wrong firmware / BL-Touch combination! Also check if you use a BL-Touch you need to connect the three wire cable to **Servo port 1**

For all newbies best advice is **_not to use_ **the BL-Touch at first yet. First install **STOCK FW** version which uses the stock proximity/inductive Z-min endstop switch. Get used to manual bed leveling and later install the BLT when you feel comfortable and then use the **BLT FW** version. (BLT, is BL- Touch, is Bed Level Touch)

**6.3.2 Z bottom and top plate bearing fitting not correct (Duplicate 2 of 2)**

If you experience play on bearings, use the following tip.

Use regular thin paper and glue with a little bit of glue stick glue the piece to the outer race of the bearing and with care slide both in place.

All depends on the play. When ready remove the paper remains not needed.

If you experience such play you can use this trick temporary and file a support ticket at TEVO for a correct version.

Bearing type: MR688ZZ, ID: 8mm; OD: 16mm; Width: 4mm.

**Please note**

**Some suffixes, e.g. ZZC have 5mm width. They might fit, however this has not been verified.**

**6.3.3 Z-Wheel Plates (New section)**

As of Apr-2017, The stock Z-wheel plates come with tapped M5 holes for the POM ACME nut screws. In order to lock the screws, you need a regular nut.

In the older version, the holes are not tapped, and a Nylock nut is needed to lock the screws.

**6.4 Wheels**

**6.4.1 “Sand feeling” or “locked” wheels (Revised section)**

These are dissects of two Tevo Mini-V wheels, and one OB Mini-V wheel.

**Watch the shoulder width.**

**Tevo wheels have 2 issues: 1) Thinner shim &amp; 2) Thicker shoulder**

Below picture shows the locking mechanism.

**Corrective actions:**

1) Try untightening the wheel to find the sweet spot where the wheel doesn’t lock or has the “sand feeling”, however still doesn’t wobble.

2) If there is no such sweet spot in your case, replace the 0.8mm shim with 1.0mm one.

3) If it is not enough, increase the width of the shim. There are cases where up to two

0.8mm, totaling 1.6mm width, were needed for proper operation.

**Please note**

**Using steps 2 or 3 would increase the width of the X-Gantry. For proper operation of the Z-system, you would need to compensate this increased width as described in the “Squar e &amp; Parall el ” annex .**

**Please note**

**At some unknown time, Tevo has increased the shim width to 1.0mm. If this is your case, then corrective action #2 is already done and you should go from corrective action #1 to #3.**

**6.6 Extrusions**

The following illustrations show the various extrusions comprising the BW frame.

The lengths shown in the table are nominal. Due to manufacturing/cutting tolerances the best you can expect these to be within +/- 0.5mm.

Please refer to **Annex 13.2, Square &amp; Parallel**, in order to assemble these extrusions correctly.

The T-Slot version is a family of extrusions with varying fillet radius at the edges, from sharp edges

shown as “Zero-Fillet T-Slot”, to full semi-circle edges shown as “Max-Fillet T-Slot”.

The V-Slot version is a special v-shaped extrusion profile, intended to be used as linear rail, in conjunction with the chamfered shaped wheels.

**Please note**

**If you ever need to replace any of the BW extrusions, make sure these are genuine V-Slot type, as shown below. Some sellers claim V-Slot however selling a T-Slot version, which does not have enough contact area with the wheels, and would also cause accelerated deterioration of the wheels.**

**6.7 Leadscrews**

The illustration below summarizes the basic information regarding leadscrews in general and the specific

BW leadscrews in particular.

**Standard Metric ACME nomenclature**

**TrDDxLL-PPp ([RH]LH)**

**Tr:** Trapezoidal (In some places you will see “**T**” only)

**DD:** Diameter in mm.

**LL:** Lead in mm.

**PP:** Pitch in mm.

**RH** (Default) / **LH**: Right Hand / Left Hand.

**Example-1**

Stock BW: **T8x2** (Metric ACME, OD: 8mm, Lead=Pitch: 2mm)

**Example-2**

OB: **Tr8x8-2p** (Metric ACME, OD: 8mm, Lead: 8mm, Pitch: 2mm (4-starts))

**Please note**

**There is a lot of confusion among the Ali sellers regarding the parameters of their leadscrews.**

**Some of the sellers will not assume responsibility, unless you buy both leadscrew and nut from the same store, and some would even sell them only in pairs.**

**In any case you MUST make sure to specify the Tr/DD/LL/PP parameters listed above and depicted in the illustration in order to prevent confusion. Mentioning the “Starts” would not hurt either. And don’t forget to specify the length you want, otherwise you’ll get the store’s default length.**

**Please note**

**OB leadscrews are 2mm pitch, 4-start, 8mm lead. They are good for fast Z travel, however you pay with resolution. If you are going to use these in your BW, make sure to order the ACME POM nuts as well, and adjust your FW Z-steps accordingly.**

**7 Electrical**

**7.1 Voltage Rating**

All electronics like the power supply, heaters, fans on the machine are rated for 24 VDC.

**7.2 PSU (Power Supply Unit) (Revised section)**

If your machine does not power-up, check the following:

- That the 110/220 cables are connected correctly.

- That the power switch is working properly.

- That you have the correct AC voltage on the PSU’s input terminals, 110 VAC or 220 VAC according to your locale.

- That the green LED on the power supply is lit then 110/220 VAC is applied. If the green LED is not lit on the power supply, then the unit is probably defective, and [you can create a support ticket](http://www.tevoprinter.com/osticket/) [with TEVO.](http://www.tevoprinter.com/osticket/)

One known cause, which is relatively easy to detect, is related to the NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) resistor/resistors inside the PSU. These resistors decrease their resistance when the temperature rises. In the case of the PSU, they are used to reduce inrush current when the power supply is switched on. In 3DP we also find them as thermistors in both the hot-end and the heat-bed, as described in other sections of this document.

**Please note**

**The following procedure is recommended for those who have the knowledge and skills with power electronics.**

**Warning**

**Opening the PSU, while the 110/220 VAC mains power is connected may be lethal. Disconnect the PSU**

**from the mains power, as well as from the control box, before attempting to open it.**

Remove the top cover of the power supply unit, by removing the screws at the side.

**Please note**

**In some PSU models, there are two of these NTC parts soldered in parallel on the PSU board, and labeled NTC1 &amp; NTC2.**

Per the pictures in the table below, and depending on your PSU model, visually check that the black NTC part/parts is/are still in good shape. If the part/parts is/are damaged, it is clearly visible, as can be seen in the picture below.

In case your PSU has 2 NTCs, and only one of them is damaged, then for safety reasons always replace both.

The table below detail the most common PSU issues.

|  |  | **Check the VAC selector switch.** |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | **Check the NTC resistor.** |
|  |  | If you have the knowledge and the experience to remove (de-solder) the one or two NTC resistors, replace them with an **NTC 5D-15** version only. |
|  |  | **Check the fuse.** |

**7.3 Power On/Off Switch**

The first series of machines were equipped with a low quality power switch. If you press the power button switch and the machine is not any more powered ON or OFF then the switch is defective. This is a known issue at TEVO.

You can issue a support ticket for a replacement part. [**http://www.tevoprinter.com/osticket/**](http://www.tevoprinter.com/osticket/)

If the switch stays in ON position you can unplug the power cable to stop the machine. If the power button switch is in the state that it is OFF you have to replace the power button switch or bridge the switch (take care this switch carries 110/220 VAC lines).

**7.4 EMI (Electro-Magnetic Interference)**

When you are printing direct from a SD (Secure Digital) card and you have random problems during printing like reverse extruding, motors stopping, shifting layers and other unexpected movements make sure the grey LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) cables are not running over the power supply. If you use a SD card for printing the data from the card to the main board gets corrupted due to electronic signals from the power supply. Reroute the cables away from the power supply like the picture shows.

You are advised to use a known working SD card to start with. If there are problems with the gift SD card that comes with the machine, you should replace it. Also low format any SD card before use. Click on the logo left for the formatter.

**7.5 Wiring**

**7.5.1 Earth Ground**

The Earth-Ground (E) wire is either colored Green, or Green/Yellow stripes. In older kits, this wire was missing, and should be added for your protection. As shown in the pictures, it is connected between the (E) terminal on the PSU’s terminal strip, and the corresponding terminal on the power plug.

**Warning**

**If you are in doubt how to do it, you should consult a certified electrician, as if wired incorrectly, it may pose a SAFETY HAZARD.**

**7.5.2 Crimped Wire Terminals**

Crimped wire terminals are preferred over either soldered terminals or bare wires, as they withstand vibrations and prevent shorts with adjacent circuits. Using these will prevent most of the connector melt-down issues. The following tables summarize the recommended terminals and crimping tools for the required applications.

|  | **Single Crimp – Not recommended** | **Double Crimp - Recommended** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Description** | 1) Plastic sleeve extends just about the metal barrel. | 1) Plastic sleeve extends few mm beyond the metal barrel. |
| **Terminal** |  |  |

| **Ring** | 9A-17A | 18A-30A | 35A-50A | **M4** ring for PSU terminal block. |
| **Pin** | 9A-17A | 18A-30A | 35A-50A | For MKS-Gen Green Screw-terminals, e.g. H1, H0, Fan, Bed &amp; PSU. |
| **Blade Female Note-2** | 3A-7A | 10A-15A | 20A-24A | Insulated, for quick disconnect, e.g. PSU to |
| **Blade Male Note-2** | 3A-7A | 10A-15A | 20A-24A | Male types suitable for the Female types above. |
| **Blade** |  |  |  | **Caution** |
| **Spade** | 9A-17A | 18A-30A | 35A-50A | **M4** spade for PSU terminal block, in case the PSU is in location where the terminal screws are difficult to reach. |
| **Butt- Splice Note-4** | 9A-17A | 18A-30A | 35A-50A | For wires requiring permanent extension. |

**Please note**

**1) AWG (American Wire Gauge) number decreases, as the wire diameter increases, therefore the lower the AWG number, the higher the current rating.**

**2) Current ratings (A) for the Ring, Blade &amp; Spade types are taken from Farnell specs.**

**3) Current ratings (A) for the Pin types are assumed to be the same as for the Ring types, as these types are clamped by screws.**

**4) Current ratings (A) for the Butt-splice types are assumed to be the same as for the Ring type, as the region between the 2 crimped wires is a solid metal.**

The following table summarizes the crimped terminals nomenclature, as it is used by some vendors, which will help you when ordering these.

| **Type** | **Nomenclature** |
| --- | --- |
| **Ring** | RV(x)-4 for 4mm screws (m4), where (x) should be replaced with 1.25 for |
| **Pin** | PTV(x)-9 or PTV(x)-10 where x remains the same as before specifying the |
| **Blade** | FDFD(x)-250 (for the double insulated female), where x again represents |
| **Blade** | MDD(x)-250 (for the male), where x again represents the AWG and 250 is |
| **Spade/Fork** | Same nomenclature as Ring-type, except SV replaces RV. |
| **Butt-Splice** | BV(x) - where x is the yet again the convention mentioned above. |

**7.5.3 USB (Universal Serial Bus) Cable**

|  | **Please note** |

**7.5.4 Layer Cooling &amp; Layer Cooling Fan**

Filaments might benefit if they are cooled when they leave the extruder nozzle in molten state,

other filaments may not be cooled.

| **Cooling table** | **PLA** | **ABS** | **PETG** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Regular layer | **YES** | **NO** | **NO** |
| Overhang | **YES** | **NO** | **YES** |

PLA is known to have a better print quality finish and less warp/curling/lifting on the edges when cooled properly. Also overhangs look better when cooled down properly.

ABS however may not be cooled at all during printing as this introduce warp/lift/curling

PETG might can be cooled at overhangs but for other printing no object/layer cooling is advised. The filament leaving the nozzle is in a molten state and first need to stick to the heat bed or next

layer. Once the first layer is on the heat bed or next layer you need to cool it to make it from molten to fixed state.

So put cool air on the layer when laid down and it has no time to warp, but if you cool the first layer it might not bond to the heat bed. So it is advised to skip cooling the first layer and preferable the first few like 0.6 mm. This can be selected and set in your preferred slicer.

If the nozzle is near the heat bed and you push a lot of cool air through the fan duct it will be reflected by the heat bed and results in an uncontrolled nozzle cool down. It might that Marlin based firmware as used in the Black Widow will show a thermal runaway if the cooling is to effective while printing.

So putting 2 fans to cool the object is overkill. What we are looking for is a fan with a fan duct that runs at a rate without cooling down the nozzle, less noise as possible with the lowest weight as possible. More is not always better…………….

**How to setup an effective cooling system.**

In Repetier HOST connect the machine by USB. We assume the object/layer fan is connected to the FAN port on the MKS GEN V1.3 or V1.4 main board. This port can be controlled by G-code to set the speed in real time or in the slicer G-code by PWM mode.

In the Manual Control section home first X/Y and Z in this order and if it is not the case move the nozzle to the center of the heat-bed with the cursor control.

In the Manual Control section:

Heat the heater to 220 degrees Celsius and when it has reached this value let it idle for 3 minutes. Heat the heat-bed to 60 degrees and let it idle for 3 minutes.

Now use the FAN slider and set it @ 10 %. Check if the fan is working as some fans need a higher value to start turning. Check on the temp graph and the nozzle temp value in the slider graph and watch if the temp goes down or stay stable. The lowest value at which the fan is working is your minimum Fan cooling value.

If the temp is not influenced and stays stable by the fan value set, raise the fan value in 1 minute intervals by 5 % until you see the temp go down by 5 degrees or more.

Your final maximum cooling fan value is the highest value reduced by 5%.

Now perform a heater/nozzle PID tune with the fan at the maximum cooling value you have obtained. In the G-code fill-in box type M303 E0 S220 P8 and click the send button to obtain the

Kp-Ki-Kd values. This process of heating and cooling the nozzle will take a few minutes. The results will be shown in the bottom screen under the graph and looks like this.

You need to fill the Kp-Ki-Kd values in Marlin firmware by LCD or FW: **Up to RC8 V3:** “**Configuration.h**” file. **As of RC8 V3.2:** “**Configuration_xxxx.h**” file, see **Section 11.1.3**. In your slicer you have options to set the minimum and maximum fan speed values for the cooling.

This way you use the maximum efficiency the cooling system has to offer without errors.

**Please note**

**If you want to use a layer cooling fan, you need to add two extra (+) and (–) wires into the drag chain.**

**These wires should come from the MKS-Gen board FAN connection. The fan speed on this connection is controlled by G-code PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) from 0 to 255.**

**7.5.5 BW Connector Types**

**Please note**

**Connector location in the following tables means CABLE/WIRE-TERMINATION side. The mating connector, on the appropriate element, is of the opposite gender, and may be either a cable type or a board type as appropriate.**

**Please note**

**JST connectors are designed whereas the pins are built into the receptacle housing, and the sockets are built into the plug housing. Therefore there is INCONSISTENCY of the Male/Female definitions among the various vendors. When ordering replacement parts, make sure to use the JST standard Plug/Receptacle definitions. If not available, make sure you are ordering the right gender.**

**7.5.6 BW Wires (Revised section)**

The electrical wires in the BW, as in any 3D printer, are subject to rapid movements and flexing, which can repeat thousands of times during one printing session. Therefore in order to survive these working conditions, they must be extremely flexible.

On the other hand, some of the wires carry large amounts of currents, therefore must be of the lowest resistance possible. This requirement can be met by using a low specific resistance metal, and/or larger wire diameter, aka gauge.

The wire which fulfills both requirements is a Copper stranded wire type, in which the core is comprised of multiple thin Copper wires stranded together.

**Please note**

**The use of CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum) wires is not recommended. They are less flexible as well as having higher resistance than their pure Copper wire counterparts having the same diameter.**

The following table summarizes the types of available wires.

| **Wire construction** | **Solid** | **Stranded** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Copper** | **Not recommended** | **Recommended** |
| **CCA** | **Not recommended** | **Not recommended** |
| **Pre-Tinned** | **Not recommended** | **Not recommended** |

The pre-tinned stranded Copper wire **is not recommended** for use inside the drag-chain.

It seems that the strands are &quot;fused&quot; by the tin coating, thus making the wire kind of solid, which could not survive the flexing.

If you must use this wire for anything running inside the drag-chain, as you have no alternative, strip a small portion of the insulation and verify that the strands are free and not fused together. If they are fused, and the wire feels stiff, you can&#039;t use it, as it will break.

The following table details the various wires used in the BW.

| **Function** | **# of** | **US** | **EU-Metric** | **Insulation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Heat-bed (+V) | 2 | 16 | 1.310 | Silicone |
| Heat-Bed (-V) | 2 | 16 | 1.310 | Silicone |
| Heat-Bed (Thermistor) | 2 | 20 | 0.518 | Silicone |
| Hot-end Fan (+/-) | 1/1 | 22 | 0.326 | Silicone |
| Layer Fan, when installed (+/-) | 1/1 | 22 | 0.326 | Silicone |
| Control-box Fan (+/-) | 1/1 | 22 | 0.326 | Silicone |
| Hot-end Thermistor | 2 | 24 | 0.205 | PTFE |
| Hot-end Heater | 2 | 22 | 0.326 | Braided |
| PSU to MKS-Gen (+/-) | 1/1 | 12 | 3.310 | Silicone |
| External MOSFET/SSR, when installed (+/-) | 1/1 | 12 | 3.310 | Silicone |
| Stepper-Motor control | 4 | 22 | 0.326 | Silicone |
| End-stop | 3 | 22 | 0.326 | Silicone |
| BLT (When installed) (Servo/End-stop) | 3/2 | 22 | 0.326 | Silicone |
| Proximity Sensor, when installed | 3 | 22 | 0.326 | Silicone |
| Mains (L/N/E) | 1/1/1 | 14 | 2.080 | PVC |

The Hot-end wires (Heater, thermistor &amp; fan), as well as the end-stop cables are pre-managed inside drag chains. If you want to add a layer-fan or a proximity sensor or the optional BLT, you need to add the wires of these into the drag-chain. The BW drag-chains have clip-on doors on each link; therefore it’s quite easy to manage additional wires, as shown in the table below.

|  | 1) Open 2-3 doors at a time. |
| --- | --- |
|  | Shown in the picture, doors #2, #3 &amp; #4 closed; |
|  | **Caution** |

A way to prevent this is by inserting the drag-chain wires inside a braided sleeve, with appropriate characteristics, as shown in the pictures.

**7.6.1 LCD cable connection diagram**

LCD cables need to be connected like shown in the picture when using a MKS GEN V 1.3 board.

**7.7 Control Board**

**7.7.1 Hot-end Power MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) Issue**

Warm up time of the hot-end from 20 to 245 degrees Celsius should take less than 2 minutes. If it

takes much longer, check the 110/220 VAC switch on the side of the PSU for correct setting.

**Warning**

**High Temp, don’t touch with bare hands!**

**Warning**

**High Voltage, don’t touch with bare hands!**

If the machine shows this message, after start of heating: **PRINTER HALTED**, this means there is an electrical or timeout problem. Press the reset button or power cycle the machine and follow troubleshoot below to start. There are a few reasons why this message pops up.

**Check also the linked section of this document Heater c an’t go higher than 180 degrees C , as this message might be related to too much fan cooling, rather than the power MOSFET.**

Hot-end check:

Check by heating the hot-end only to 35 degrees Celsius for a minimum of 10 minutes and check if the temp stays stable.

**Check if LED D9 is constant ON, or blinking**

**Green.**

If it blinks, the heater hardware and cables are correct.

If it is constant ON, check if the screw, that clamps the heat-cartridge in the heat-block, is present and tightened sufficiently. Check all cables and connectors. Check with a Digital voltmeter if the Green E0 connector has 24 VDC when the Green LED D9 is constant ON.

**7.7.2 Heat-bed Power MOSFET Issue**

Warm up time of the heat-bed from 20 to 80 degrees Celsius takes ~3 minutes. If it takes much longer, check the 110/220 VAC switch on the side of the PSU for correct setting. And check by hand touch if all parts of the heat-bed are equally heated.

**Caution: Temp higher than 60 C may cause burns !**

**Warning: High Voltage, don’t touch with bare hands!**

If the machine shows this message, after start of heating: **PRINTER HALTED,** this means there is an electrical or timeout problem. Press the reset button or power cycle the machine and follow troubleshoot below to start. There are a few reasons why this message pops up.

Heat-bed check:

If you power up the machine and the LED D11 is constant ON (heat-bed temp rises without control) the main board MKS V1.3 or V1.4 is defective. Open a service ticket.

In others cases…….

Check by heating the heat-bed only to 35 degrees Celsius for a minimum of 10 minutes and check if the temp stays stable.

**Check if LED D11 is constant ON, or blinking**

**Green.**

If it blinks, the heat-bed hardware and cable are correct.

If it is constant ON, check with a Digital voltmeter if the Green heat-bed connector has

24 VDC when the green LED D11is constant ON. Also check by hand if the heat-bed is evenly warm.

**If the machine heats up the heat-bed uncontrollable and D11 is constant ON at power up then the Q6 FET is blown. Open a support ticket at TEVO to exchange the mainboard.**

Due to failing Q6 power MOSFETs which control the heat-bed (reason is probably over-stressing of Q6), then from 18-Dec-2016 TEVO QC (Quality Control) checks all boards (they say) and adds a small heat-sink on the heat-bed MOSFET. The heat-sink will not do any work but it lets you know you have a factory QC tested board.

If you opened a support ticket, because you had a main board with failed Q6, TEVO ships replacements MKS GEN V1.4 main boards from

25-Dec-2016 now equipped with new type

power MOSFET named [**AOB1404L**](http://www.aosmd.com/pdfs/datasheet/AOB1404L.pdf)Replacement versions known to be working for DIY (Do It Yourself) jobs: [**CSD18536KTTT**](http://html.alldatasheet.com/html-pdf/804075/TI1/CSD18536KTTT/59/1/CSD18536KTTT.html)

In case you have a new MKS GEN V1.4 main board, which is not sourced from TEVO, and you don’t trust the soldering of the Q6 power MOSFET, you can use this trick to bypass a possible bad soldering problem. Solder a thick wire of 1 mm^2 minimum (preferable Silicone), from the center pin of the Q6 FET to the Minus (-

) pin of the heat-bed connector, at the bottom of the board as shown.

If after a repower of the machine LED 9 or LED11 are constant on then the MKS main board is defective.

**7.7.3 Heat-bed Offload - External Power MOSFET**

Due to the problems with the MKS GEN V1.4 boards TEVO designed a high power **EHD (E**xternal **H**eat-bed **D**river) board. From 13- Jan-2017 all warranty MKS GEN V1.3 and V

1.4 replacements boards get this **EHD** standard shipped along with a new MKS GEN V1.4 main board.

For connection diagram, refer to **Section**

**7.10.4**.

**Caution**

**Take care of the polarities.**

**7.7.4 Heat-bed Offload - External SSR (Solid State Relay)**

You may accomplish the same heat-bed offload functionality, by using an industry standard SSR. This is an electronic SPST (Single Pole Single Throw) switch, which is connected in series on the +24V line, between the PSU and the heat-bed, and is controlled by the “Bed” output of the MKS- Gen controller.

**Please note**

**The SSR should be rated for AT LEAST 40A, and fitted with an appropriate heat-sink, as shown in the picture.**

For connection diagram, refer to **Section**

**7.10.7**.

**Caution**

**Take care of the polarities.**

**7.7.5 Connectors**

**Please note**

**MKS GEN V1.3 and V1.4 boards are the same as far as functionality is concerned, and either can be used in a Black Widow.**

**7.8 Endstops**

**7.8.1 XYZ proximity sensors adjustment (Duplicate 2 of 2)**

The X Y and Z sensors are proximity inductive sensors which sense metal. To get them working properly adjust them at a very close distance (maximum 1mm) to the part that should activate it. The sensors have a small orange LED built-in. When the sensor is activated the orange LED is ON. You can use a tip of a screw driver to test the sensor for working.

**7.8.2 Using proximity sensor for heat-bed ABL (Auto Bed Leveling)**

For heat-bed auto leveling, you may opt to use a capacitive or an inductive proximity sensor, instead of the BLT. This sensor will do both functions of Z-endstop and heat-bed auto-leveling.

Since these sensors are neither BW stock , or BW option, the mounting/connection-diagrams/FW

for these are annexed to this guide, and full instructions can be found in **Annex 13.3**.

**7.9 Octoprint**

[**Octoprint** is](https://octopi.octoprint.org/) a print server based on a Raspberry Pi. Currently with the Raspberry Pi3 which has on board Wi-Fi the use of it has been made easier. What do you need? Raspberry Pi3, 2 Amp 5 VDC power supply with USB micro connector, 4Gb SD micro card, USB A-B cable. Follow Toms video and you’re done.

**7.10 Connection Diagrams**

**Warning**

**Heat-bed versions V1, V2 &amp; V3 ARE NOT synchronized in time with the power switch versions V1, V2 &amp; V3 respectively. You must verify your setup according to the heat-bed and power switch sections, and then use the appropriate diagram.**

**The power switch V1 &amp; V2 has the “N” terminal connected to the “N” terminal of the PSU. In power switch V3, the “GND” terminal MUST NOT be connected to either the “N” or the “E” terminals of the PSU.**

**Please note**

**In order to reduce clutter and enhance readability, some wire bundles are drawn with a single line having the backlash symbol and a number, e.g. \2, denoting the number of wires in the bundle.**

**Please note**

**The BL-Touch option can be fitted to any heat-bed/power-switch combination, however the BL-Touch is mutually exclusive with the end-stop Z-min sensor, therefore only one of them can be connected to the controller board.**

**Please note**

**Layer fan has been added to the diagrams although it is neither stock, nor an option, as this is a must for PLA and most users opt to add it as one of the first mods after the build.**

**Please note**

**The BL-Touch option can be fitted to any heat-bed/power-switch combination, however the**

**BL-Touch is mutually exclusive with the end-stop Z-min sensor, therefore only one of them can be connected to the controller board.**

**7.10.8 Heat-bed V4**

**Please note**

**Although it has not been officially confirmed by TEVO, heat-bed V4 is the same as V3 as far as electrical design is concerned, with the addition of a thermal insulator on the bottom side.**

**Please refer to the previous sections for the appropriate V3 connection diagrams.**

**8 Electro-Mechanical**

This section is for elements which convert electrical energy to mechanical energy (motion), and vice versa, e.g. stepper motors, fans and mechanical end-stops like the BL-Touch.

**8.1 Stepper-Motors**

There are three “driver sticks” which are compatible with the MKS-Gen V1.3/V1.4 controllers and the stock stepper motors, which used by the stock BW. These are the stock TI-DRV8825, the Allegro-A4988 and the Trinamic-TMC2100\. The detailed instructions for each of these driver sticks appear in the following sections. The orientation of these sticks on the driver pin headers is shown in the following picture.

**Please note**

**One stick from each type is shown. Normally all 4 drivers are of the same type.**

**8.1.1 Stepper Motor Drivers – DRV8825**

|  | The Black Widow comes standard with DRV8825 driver boards set at 1/32 micro steps. However the machine with this setting has troubles for printing with the so called Salomon Skin effect. To reduce the effect it is recommended to use other drivers or set the DRV8825 drivers into |

|  | This picture shows what is called the “Salmon Skin” effect. |
| To reduce the Salmon Skin effect completely, you should use the [**official TMC2100-5V Silent StepSicks**](http://www.watterott.com/en/SilentStepStick-TMC2100-5V)[**from Watterott**.](http://www.watterott.com/en/SilentStepStick-TMC2100-5V) These drivers are also reducing the stepper noise to a minimum. Preferably on the X-Y- Z-E axis. |
| **Caution: When using the Black version, you MUST disconnect the USB cable, or ANY OTHER external 5V line, BEFORE powering off the BW, in order to prevent driver damage. See Section 7.5.3.** | **Please note** |

**Step-5:**

Halve the E-Steps in FW, as shown on the left pane.

**Up to RC8 V3:** “**Configuration.h**” file.

**As of RC8 V3.2:** “**Configuration_xxxx.h**” file, see **Section 11.1.3**.

If you have calibrated your E-Steps before, the calibration would remain valid, after halving your E-Steps.

However if you haven’t done so, and relied of the default numbers, you may find that dimensions deviate more than you would like, after halving the E-Steps.

Therefore now is the time to perform the calibration. You may use this [**video** which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfqeTzc3NpM) shows how to do this for the Tarantula. The procedure for the BW is the same, and you should use the BW equivalent locations for attaching the needles and rulers.

**8.1.4 Stock Stepper Motors**

Since the beginning of 2017, TEVO is shipping the BW with TEVO branded 17HD40005-C5.18 stepper motors.

TEVO has officially confirmed that these are an

OEM version of the previously shipped Busheng

17HD40005-22B.

**8.1.5 E-Steps Tuning via LCD or M92 Command (New section)**

If you have to change any of the steps of X-Y-Z- E and you upload the firmware always check, using the LCD menu, that the new settings are accepted.

Changing the values through the LCD panel:

1) &gt;control&gt;motion&gt;Steps/mm and adjust the value required (press the knob to accept new value).

2) &gt;control&gt;store memory (press knob to save values to EEPROM).

Changing the values by using G-code command line from Pronterface, or other utility:

1) M92 X?? Y?? Z?? E??. Fill in the value you like to be used at the question marks.

2) M500\. To finish the sequence. This saves the values in the EEPROM.

**8.2 Fans**

**8.2.1 Extruder/Hot-end fan noise reduction**

Implementing automatic enable and disable of active cooling fan for the BW.

Step -1

Identify your fan wires and note the polarity orientation, (Red + ,Black-), then disconnect the wires from the PSU, and connect them to the MKS Gen V 1.3 or V1.4 main board, into the “HE1” (Heater E1) socket and take care of the polarity.

Step -2

Enabling the auto cooling in the firmware:

Open the Marlin FW: **Up to RC8 V3:** “**Configuration_adv.h**” file. **As of RC8 V3.2:** “**Configuration_adv_xxxx.h**” file, see **Section 11.1.3**. Scroll about a third the way down until you see the “Extruder cooling fans” section. Change the current #define E0_AUTO_FAN_PIN -1 to #define E0_AUTO_FAN_PIN 7\. If the function is disabled remove the forward slashes (//) before the “#define E0_AUTO_FAN_PIN“

Now verify and upload the firmware to your printer.

**8.2.2 Heater fan failure**

The stock heater fan is prone to fail at start or after a while in use. If you have to tap it to get it start running or it varies in speed constantly you have to file a support ticket at TEVO or buy a

new one which should be 24 VDC or use a 12 VDC one with a step down converter. [**Noctua 40mm**](http://noctua.at/en/nf-a4x10-flx)

[**fans** are](http://noctua.at/en/nf-a4x10-flx) known for their silent working and are resonance free. A fan without resonance also enhances the measuring of the BL-Touch if this one is used.

**8.3 BL-Touch Option**

**Caution**

**The BLT sections in this guide are valid ONLY to the ANTCLABS BL-Touch. If you are using a clone, some or all of the relevant information, including the FW, may not apply and/or not work properly.**

**8.3.1 Mounting Bracket**

**Up to Mar-2017, this option did not come with a mounting bracket for the BLT sensor!!! Therefore the machine could not be used for printing with BLT when assembly is done.** If you have an older machine and would like to overcome this problem, you need someone to print for you a BLT mounting bracket. This can also be done by a local 3D print-service/hub.

|  | **Please note** |
| --- | --- |
|  | **Please note** |

A community simple bracket can be found at [**http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1950504**.](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1950504)

Official mounting brackets by the BLT vendor:

[**http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1761761** L](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1761761)arge version. You need two M4 screws and nuts!

[**http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1721703** S](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1721703)mall version. You need two M4 screws and nuts!

A modular design which allows for many combinations of Hot-end/Extruder/Sensor can be found

at [**http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1829292**.](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1829292)

**8.3.2 Installation**

We assume the BLT is correctly installed on the machine 8.0 mm from tip nozzle to BLT reference line, as shown in the picture.

**8.3.3 Wiring &amp; Connection Diagram**

This is the correct connection schematic for hooking up the BL-Touch. You can only connect one Z- min endstop connector!

**Connector Legend**

**BLT 3-wire, which connects to the Servo-S1 connector:**

Orange arrow: SIGNAL. Red Arrow: PLUS. Black Arrow: GND.

**BLT 2-wire, which connects to the Z-Min connector:**

Black Arrow: GND. White Arrow: Z-Min.

Test your BLT when it is connected this way only. Do not use any other servo port even if it is shown in the video we refer to. That video is purely for how to install Arduino IDE and U8glib but uses servo port 4, which is not used in the Marlin firmware for the Black Widow with BL-Touch.

If you order a BL-Touch option, you get two extra cables which you need to put in the drag chain.

There is also a third 3 wire extension cable. Connect this one to the 3 wire cable in the drag

chain and **servo port 1 on the MKS V1.3 board**. So this cable is built now from two parts. Search the connector green labeled “Limit switch Z-“. Disconnect the connectors.

Connect the white/red cable coming from the BL-Touch 2 wire cable to the Limit switch Z-. Do not disconnect the Z-min endstop on the main board. The connection needs to be made

outside the control box.

Make sure the BL-Touch cables are connected like the picture shows.

2 wire &gt; White / White – Red / Black

3 wire &gt; White / Orange – Red / Red – Black / Black

**8.3.4 FW (Firmware) (Duplicate 1 of 2)**

This machine is equipped with Marlin RC7 BL-Touch firmware. At power up it will show the TEVO and BL-Touch logo. **Up to Mar-2017, this option did not come with a mounting bracket for the BLT sensor!!! Therefore the machine could not be used for printing with BLT when assembly is done.** If you have an older machine and would like to overcome this problem, you need someone to print for you a BLT mounting bracket. This can also be done by a local 3D print-service/hub.

Or you have to downgrade the firmware first to **STOCK FW**, **and use the stock**

**proximity/inductive Z – min endstop first.**

Therefore this machine/BL-Touch combo is not recommended for newbie 3D printing. The BL- Touch can be purchased later and installed if needed.

**Please note**

**As of Apr-2017, TEVO is providing a metal BLT mounting bracket, shown below, when ordering the BW with the BLT option. Therefore it is possible to print upon finishing the assembly using the stock BLT FW. However it is highly recommended to upgrade to the latest RC8 community BLT FW, in order to have all the Marlin/community updates/bug-fixes.**

**8.3.5 Self-Test**

**Always start with this first !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

1] Disconnect the USB cable. Power on the machine. The BL-Touch pin should go out and in 2 times and then the light should be solid red.

If it does not go in and out check the 3 wire servo cable as it does not get 5 Volt power. No need to proceed if the self-test is not working! Solve this first! By doubt if the cable and connectors from MKS GEN V1.3 board to the BLT are not faulty you can try to connect the 3 wire servo cable directly to the Servo port 1 on the MKS GEN V1.3 board.

If the BLT starts to flash red. It might that the top of the BL-Touch pin is deformed as it ran into

the heat bed during previous test!! Remove the hexagon screw at the top of the BL-Touch. Remove the pin and check the top. The heat shrink part should be uniform round. The picture shows a deformed top part. If this is the case use a hairdryer and warm the heat shrink and form it to a circular round shape.

Assemble the BLT again and make sure the top of the hexagon screw is flush with the top of the

BLT mounting.

**Do not adjust the BL-Touch screw for adjustments reason if the pin gets stuck. The screw should be flush.**

2] Connect the USB cable to the machine. The BL-Touch cable should be connected to the correct spot on the MKS V1.3 board servo port 1\. Make sure the correct firmware is on the MKS V1.3 board. Currently we advise the **BLT FW** version. Open [**Repetier,**](https://www.repetier.com/download-software/)[**Pronterface** o](http://koti.kapsi.fi/~kliment/printrun/)r any controller program that can send G-codes on a command line. Make sure the machine is detected by the software!

Send the following M-codes to test the BL-Touch: M280 P0 S10 ; pushes the pin down

M280 P0 S90 ; pulls the pin up

M280 P0 S120 ; Self-test – keeps going until you do pin up/down or release alarm

M280 P0 S160 ; Release alarm

**8.3.6 Calibration**

These instructions were written to explain how to calibrate using a computer connected through the USB port to your printer.

**Caution**

**During the whole procedure, you must have your hand on the master switch, ready to shut off the printer. This is a look ahead measure in order to prevent the BLT and/or the nozzle from crashing into the heat-bed, in case of improper operation.**

**1) ANTCSLABS BLT pin test for Z-home:**

1.1) Send G28 XY; Homing X and Y axis first.

You can only use G28 Z if G28 XY is performed first otherwise you get an error message on the display: “**Z forbidden**”.

1.2) Send G28 Z; Homing the Z-axis only downwards.

**Caution**

**Z-homing should be at the center of the heat-bed. If it’s not, you are probably not using the correct FW variant.**

1.3) As soon as the Z axis moves downwards, touch the tip of the BLT and verify that it detects the pin correctly. It should stop and resume moving downwards after you release the pin. Touch the tip of the BLT again, to double check that the Z-min endstop is working correctly.

1.4) If the Z axis keeps moving downwards, switch off the main power immediately. Check first that the 2-wire sensor cable, from the ANTCLABS BLT to the main board, is wired correctly.

1.5) If your head moves upwards only, then you have the 2 wire sensor cable, from the ANTCLABS BLT to the main board, connected wrong, i.e. connected to the Zmax (X+) instead of the Zmin (Z-).

**2) End stop status:**

2.1) Send M119 which is the G-code command to check the end stop status.

X,Y and Z should report their status as **OPEN** when not activated. If Z says **TRIGGERED** then your wiring is faulty. The 2 wire cable and connector should be checked for reverse and/or faulty connection.

**3) Calibration:**

3.1) Send M851; note the number.

3.2) Send M851 Z0; sets the offset to zero.

3.3) Send G28; homing all axes.

3.4) Send G1 Z0; when homed the LCD display should show **Z = 0**.

3.5) From the machine LCD display go to **Menu** then: **Prepare**/**Move axis**/**0.1mm**/**Move Z.**

Now move the Z axis slowly down until the nozzle is at the right distance from the build plate (an

A4 paper thickness).

**Please note**

**The Z axis value on the display it should be something like -1.5.**

3.6) Send M851 Z-1.5; to set the offset you got in the previous step.

If you find that you need to increase or decrease the gap then do either:

3.6.a) Send M851 Z-1.4; this would make the gap bigger.

3.6.b) Send M851 Z-1.6; this would make the gap smaller.

**4) EEPROM:**

10) Send M500; to save the value to EEPROM so that it is not reset when you power the printer off and on (Remember the -1.4, -1.5 and -1.6 are just examples, yours may be different).

**8.3.7 Auto bed leveling**

For correct so called Auto-bed levelling the official Marlin RC7 BLT supplied on the machine might not be working correct. This has nothing to do with the BL-Touch itself but is (was) Marlin bug

related. Download the **BLT FW** version.

**9 Electro-Optical**

This section is for elements which convert electrical energy to optical energy (light), and vice versa, e.g. LEDs.

**9.1 Led Strip**

With your kit you receive two items as a gift. One item is two LED strips which you can

connect directly to the 24 VDC of the Power Supply Unit. If they do not work check the polarity. There have been reports that the polarity signs on the strip were wrong. So double check.

**10 Electro-Thermal**

This section is for elements which convert electrical energy to thermal energy (heat), and vice versa, e.g. hot-end, heat-bed and thermistors.

**10.1 Hot-end**

**10.1.1 Hot-end Versions**

The latest version V3 (as of Sep-2016) come with a **cloned** E3D-V6 (Retrofit #2) hot-end unit. Previous versions of hot-ends are prone to cause problems and will be swapped by TEVO if you

open a support ticket. For Hot-end V3 refer to **Section-4.6**.

**Caution**

**Versions V1 (Original) &amp; V2 (Retrofit #1) are obsolete and should not be used, as they may pose a safety/fire hazard. Only V3 (Retrofit #2) should be used.**

As it comes from TEVO, the nozzle sits against the heat-block, not the heat-break, thus may cause leakage of filament above the heat-block.

**Caution**

**Before use, it is advised to check that the nozzle is locked against the heat-break, as shown in the following illustrations. Current heat-blocks are equipped with white paste. Take care if/when you disassemble it to remove the stuff. Be careful with tools when you remove the nozzle or heat-break.**

The following illustrations show the stock V1 hot-end, which was originally shipped to about 200 customers. **The V1 is obsolete**.

The following illustrations show the stock V2 hot-end, which was shipped as retrofit #1 to about

200 customers who initially received V1, as well as to new customers. **The V2 is obsolete**.

**10.1.2 Converting to V3 Hot-end**

For those who have the V1 and V2 hot-end unit and want to convert to the V3 version, they need to add two spacers. They can be found here: [**http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1708185**](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1708185)

With the new machines after Sep-2016, the spacers come with the kit.

**10.1.3 Warm up time**

Warm up time of the hot-end from 20 to 245 degrees Celsius should take less than 2 minutes. If it takes much longer, there might be 2 classes of issues. For the Thermal class, please read on the following section. For the Electrical class, please check the appropriate **Control Board** section.

**Warning**

**High Temp, don’t touch with bare hands!**

**Warning**

**High Voltage, don’t touch with bare hands!**

**10.1.4 Hot-end can’t go higher than 180 Degrees-C**

|  | You only want to cool the cool zone. With current BW design with the E3D V6 clone |
| --- | --- |
|  | When you build the kit and start the first print and your heater can not reach higher temps than 180 degrees, or PID tuning at higher temps fail. It might that the fan is also blowing on the nozzle part of the heater, cooling it down. Cut a playing card with a slot and place the card or any thin cardboard in between the two lowest slots/fin of the aluminum cooling cylinder. Take care the cardboard does not touch the lower hot part. As the picture shows the cool air is blocked and can’t reach the nozzle area. |
|  |  |

**10.1.5 Thermistor**

With your kit you receive two items as a gift.

One item is an extra thermistor for the hot-end heat-block.

This thermistor is a 100Kohm NTC resistor with beta of 3950 PPM/degree-C. (PPM=Parts Per Million) This thermistor is encapsulated inside a tiny glass bulb.

FW configuration: **Up to RC8 V3:** “**Configuration.h**” file should be:

#define TEMP_SENSOR_0 11 (**for E0 extruder**)

#define TEMP_SENSOR_1 11 (**for E1 extruder**)

FW configuration: **As of RC8 V3.2:** “**Configuration_xxxx.h**” file, see **Section 11.1.3**, should be:

#define TEMP_SENSOR_0 127 (**for E0 extruder**)

#define TEMP_SENSOR_1 127 (**for E1 extruder**)

**Please note**

**This thermistor can’t be used on the heat-bed, as is, since the heat-bed uses an SMD type thermistor. If you need to use it for the heat-bed, refer to Section 10.2.3 for instructions.**

**10.2 Heat-bed**

**10.2.1 Heat-bed versions**

Heat-bed V1 has design flaw, whereas Zone-1 is shorted thus not heating. The thermistor is at the un-heated zone; therefore temperature readings are completely wrong. If you happen to have

this version, you should replace it.

Heat-bed Ver-2 is a corrected version. It has successive less heating as moving away from the feeding point, and has the thermistor at the hottest, however no significant issues reported by using it.

**Please note**

**V1 &amp; V2 have had the SAME pinout. Only the colors of the cable wires are different. (+) lines are**

**Red and Thermistor lines are Yellow.**

**Therefore cables of V1 &amp; V2 are interchangeable, as you can&#039;t plug the thermistor plug into the heat-bed connector, regardless of the color.**

Heat-bed V3 is a new design which is much better, as the thermistor is at the center, and zones 2,

3a &amp;3b are heating about the same, whereas zone 1 is heating a bit more.

**Warning**

**When replacing either V1 or V2 heat-beds with the new V3, you MUST replace the cable as well!**

**Using either V1 or V2 cables with the V3 bed would destroy your MKS controller!!! (It will inject**

**+24VDC to the thermistor port of the controller chip)**

**Heat-bed V4**

**Please note**

**Although it was not officially confirmed by TEVO, heat-bed V4 is the same as V3 as far as electrical design is concerned, with the addition of a thermal insulator on the bottom side.**

**It has 4 heating quadrants, thermistor chip located at the center of the bed, and connector wire colors as shown in the above V3 illustration.**

**10.2.2 Heat-bed Wiring &amp; Resistance Values**

|  | **Warning:** |
| --- | --- |
|  | **Thermistor pin locations are given, when viewed from the TOP of the bed** |
|  |  | Ver | Date | Nominal | Nominal | Thermistor | Thermistor |  |
|  |  | V1 | Introduction | 1.6 | 15 | Right | Red |  |
|  |  | V2 | Oct-2016 | 1.6 | 15 | Right | Yellow |  |
|  |  | V3 | 01-Jan-2017 | 2.0 | 12 | Center | Yellow |  |
|  |  | V4 | Feb-2017 ?? | 2.0 | 12 | Center | Yellow |  |

**10.2.3 Thermistor**

The heat-bed thermistor is a 100Kohm NTC SMD chip resistor with beta of 3950 PPM/degree-C. It is soldered to he bottom of the heat-bed, and covered with a thermal insulation pad and Kapton tape, to keep it at the heat-bed temperature, which prevents erroneous readings.

**Heat-bed V1**

As shown in Section 10.2.1, the thermistor is placed in a non-heated zone, therefore the reading is completely wrong. If you are still using this version, you should attach the gift thermistor to the recess at the center of the bed, which is shown in the following picture, and cover it with insulation pad and Kapton tape. Then connect it directly to the TB connector on the MKS-Gen, by replacing the **Red wires** stock connection which is shown in **Section 7.10.1**.

FW configuration: **Up to RC8 V3:** “**Configuration.h**” file should be:

#define TEMP_SENSOR_BED 11

FW configuration: **As of RC8 V3.2:** “**Configuration_xxxx.h**” file, see **Section 11.1.3**, should be:

#define TEMP_SENSOR_BED 11

**Heat-bed V2**

As shown in Section 10.2.1, the thermistor is placed at the heat-bed’s edge, therefore the reading is wrong. If you are still using this version and you want a better performance, you can attach the gift thermistor to the recess at the center of the bed, which is shown in the following picture, and cover it with insulation pad and Kapton tape. Then connect it directly to the TB connector on the MKS-Gen, by replacing the **Yellow wires** stock connection which is shown in **Section 7.10.2**.

FW configuration: **Up to RC8 V3:** “**Configuration.h**” file should be:

#define TEMP_SENSOR_BED 11

FW configuration: **As of RC8 V3.2:** “**Configuration_xxxx.h**” file, see **Section 11.1.3**, should be:

#define TEMP_SENSOR_BED 11

|  | **Heat-bed V3** |
| --- | --- |
|  | **And certainly don’t peel off the thermal insulation pad, as this will cause erroneous readings.** |

**Heat-bed V4**

**Please note**

**Although it was not officially confirmed by**

**TEVO, heat-bed V4 is the same as V3 as far as electrical design is concerned, with the addition of a thermal insulator on the bottom side.**

**The thermistor is at the center of the heat-bed, as shown in the above V3 illustrations.**

**The insulation at the bottom is made of PET foam (Polyethylene terephthalate) covered with an Aluminum foil.**

**10.2.4 Glass printing surface**

To have a flat printing surface you can use a 250x400 mm –3 or 4mm thick regular window glass plate. No need for expensive Borosilicate or Tempered glass. Avoid the use of binder clamps/clips to mount the glass plate to the heat-bed. You can use tape to attach it to the heat-bed at the sides or use 0.5 mm silicone thermal pads in between.

**Caution: Glass may shatter if hit by the hot-end. Use care when calibrating the Z-homing.**

This prevents the glass plate to move but allows expansion of the glass and gives easy placing. Larger pads are advised if you regularly need to lift the glass plate. You can use **Auqanett** hairspray or **3Dlac**, or **Magigoo** for correct bonding of the first layer.

**Warning: Never apply aerosol based sprays on a heated heat-bed while hot to prevent explosion of the gasses.**

Other option is to clean the glass with Isopropyl 96% alcohol or Windex window cleaner. Use a

razor blade to clean the surface first. Let the alcohol or fluid evaporate first!

**Warning: Never apply alcohol based fluids on a heated heat-bed while hot.**

Due to the thickness of the glass plate you need to preheat the heat-bed longer so the glass plate can receive the radiation heat from the heat-bed to overcome the airgap. Approx. 5 minutes extra heat up time is recommended. Larger pads 50x50 mm transduce the heat quicker. A full heat-bed is preferable equipped with 12 pads of 50 x 50 mm.

**10.2.5 Warm up time**

Warm up time of the heat-bed from 20 to 80 degrees Celsius takes ~3 minutes. If it takes much

longer, check the appropriate **Control Board** section.

**Caution: Temp higher than 60 C may cause burns !**

**Warning: High Voltage, don’t touch with bare hands!**

**11 FW**

**11.1 FW Variants (Revised section)**

TEVO delivers two Black Widow variants, the stock and the BLT option. BW community has evolved these, as well as adding more variants as required. The following sections detail the various FW variants.

In the Marlin Github repository, line numbers are shown. You may want to enable the line numbers in the Arduino FW interface. In order to do so, you need to click “**Ctrl+Comma**” to open the “**Preferences**” window, and tick the “**Display line numbers**” box, as shown in the following figures.

**Please note**

**If you know the line number and want to jump to it, you should click “Ctrl+L”. If you don’t know the**

**line number, you should search the appropriate strings by clicking “Ctrl+F”.**

**Caution**

**Up to Marlin RC8 V3, all settings like E-Steps, PID, stepper motor direction &amp; pin-assignments are done in either the “Configuration.h” and/or the “Configuration_adv.h” files as appropriate.**

**As of Marlin RC8 V3.2 these settings need to be done in either the “Configuration_xxxx.h” and/or the “Configuration_adv_xxxx.h” files respectively, whereas “xxxx” currently stands for either STOCK or BLT or PROX. See Section 11.1.3.**

**11.1.1 Stock (Non-BLT)**

This machine is equipped with Marlin RC7 firmware. At power up it will show the TEVO logo. The machine can be used without any firmware modification to start printing. If you are a newbie to

3D printing buy this version. Manual bed leveling on the Black Widow is easy and only needs to be

done once a week maximum due to the stable framework but depending on your printing needs. This version uses the original proximity/inductive Z-min stop! When the machine is working and calibrated you can print the BL-Touch mount first if needed. You **cannot mix** firmware using the BL-Touch and the inductive Z-min endstop! It is one or the other. If you want to upgrade to the latest RC8 firmware, it can be found under the Community FW section below, under **STOCK FW**.

**11.1.2 BLT Option (Duplicate 2 of 2)**

This machine is equipped with Marlin RC7 BL-Touch firmware. At power up it will show the TEVO and BL-Touch logo. **Up to Mar-2017, this option did not come with a mounting bracket for the BLT sensor!!! Therefore the machine could not be used for printing with BLT when assembly is done.** If you have an older machine and would like to overcome this problem, you need someone to print for you a BLT mounting bracket. This can also be done by a local 3D print-service/hub.

Or you have to downgrade the firmware first to **STOCK FW**, **and use the stock proximity/inductive Z – min endstop first.**

Therefore this machine/BL-Touch combo is not recommended for newbie 3D printing. The BL-

Touch can be purchased later and installed if needed.

**Please note**

**As of Apr-2017, TEVO is providing a metal BLT mounting bracket, shown below, when ordering the BW with the BLT option. Therefore it is possible to print upon finishing the assembly using the stock BLT FW. However it is highly recommended to upgrade to the latest RC8 community BLT FW, in order to have all the Marlin/community updates/bug-fixes.**

**11.1.3 Community FW by Rob Mendon**

As of Marlin 1.1.0 RC8 V3.2 the BW FW is built in a modular fashion, i.e. there is a central **Configuration.h** and **Configuration_adv.h** files which are used to choose one of the specific configuration files. These specific files are named **Configuration_xxxx.h** and **Configuration_adv_xxxx.h** respectively, whereas **xxxx** is per the table below.

There are currently 3 configurations corresponding to the 3 FW variants. In the future, as the community needs evolve, more configurations will be added in the same modular fashion.

The rationale behind this is the need to add more basic configurations for the community on one hand, and on the other hand to prevent complex if/then/else statements in which one error would break the whole system. In the modular design, if a new added variant is not working, it does not impact the previous proven variants.

The following table summarizes the FW variants.

**Please note**

**The FW assumes stock BW components, i.e. DRV8825 stepper drivers and geared extruder. If you are using a different setup, you should update the appropriate parameters, e.g. E-Steps,**

**e.g. stepper direction, in YOUR SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION FILE per the table below, as explained elsewhere in this guide.**

| **Name of** | **Auto Bed leveling** | **Configuration_xxxx.h** | **Configuration_adv_xxxx.h** | **Links to** |

**11.2 USB Drivers (Duplicate 1 of 2)**

**If you install the Arduino IDE then the USB drivers are installed automatically for Windows and**

**Macintosh OS (Operating System).**

The separate USB driver for the MKS V1.3 and V1.4 control board can be downloaded from the FTDI (Future Technology Devices International) site.

The machine uses a Windows VCP (Virtual Com Port) RS232\. Marlin uses by standard a baud rate of 250,000 bps.

**If you need to set a baud rate use AUTO or select 250,000 for any PC related communication.**

[**http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm**](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm)

**Choose the correct operating system!**

**11.3 Arduino firmware upgrade / downgrade (Revised section)**

**Caution**

**Before uploading a new FW into the controller; make sure you have copied all configuration changes**

**you have done in your current version’s configuration.**

**Each new upload overrides all configuration parameters!!!**

For uploading firmware (machine control settings) you need to install Arduino software. Arduino is free full function software to perform this firmware upgrade. Version 1.6.12 is OK and tested on Windows

10\. [**https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software**](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

**!------------------------- If the U8glib is not installed correctly you get compilation errors -----------------!**

**If you download the Arduino IDE file you have to unzip it first in a separate directory. If you do not, not all the files will show up. Then open Marlin.ino by double click from the Marlin folder.**

If Arduino is installed open the Marlin.ino from the downloaded file, inside Arduino click Sketch &gt; Include Library &gt; Manage Libraries.

In the &quot;filter your search&quot; box, type U8glib. When the U8glib shows up, click on Install.

**Make sure all other programs that can communicate with the com port like Pronterface, Repetier or**

**Simplify3D need to be closed while uploading.**

For how to upload machine firmware you can use [**this video a**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPNptiXuVCY)**s a guide**. Use Mega 2560 as board in

Arduino IDE. You have to choose only different files to upload from the file section, do not use other

Marlin files. Do not use servo port 4 for connecting BL-Touch as shown in the video but **servo port 1**.

For Black Widow (Stock without BL-Touch) &gt;&gt;&gt; **STOCK FW**

For Black Widow (with BL-Touch) &gt;&gt;&gt; **BLT FW**

For Black Widow (with Inductive/Capacitive Proximity sensor) &gt;&gt;&gt; **PROX FW**

All settings like E-Steps, PID, stepper motor direction &amp; pin-assignment need to be done in the appropriate configuration files, as described in Section 11.1.3\. Once you change a setting, you have to upload the changes.

**11.4 PID Tuning**

To optimize the heating of the heater and heat- bed you can perform a so called PID tuning. By default the PID tuning for both the hot-end heater and the heat-bed are **ON**.

Only do PID heater tuning with a proper hot-end fan duct mounted, or using means to prevent

hot-end over-cooling, as depicted in the section titled: **Hot-end c an’t g o higher t han 1 80 Degrees-C**.

**Please note**

**As of Marlin RC8 V3.2 FW, the default hot-end thermistor table in the FW has been changed, to track more accurately the hot-end temp. Therefore after upgrading to V3.2 or later revision, it is recommended to perform PID tuning in order to have the correct PID coefficients.**

[**http://reprap.org/wiki/PID_Tuning**](http://reprap.org/wiki/PID_Tuning)[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APzJfYAgFkQ**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APzJfYAgFkQ)[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU2S1heu3XU**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU2S1heu3XU)

**11.5 E-Steps Tuning for 0.4mm Nozzle (Revised section)**

|  | Take a drinking straw (preferable transparent or translucent) and cut it to a 120 mm length. |
| --- | --- |
|  | At a 20 mm distance from the bottom put a line mark on the drinking straw. |
|  | With a scissor slice over the full length the drinking straw open. |
|  | Slide the drinking straw over the filament and place it on top of the extruder unit. |

Change the value in the Marlin FW:

**Up to RC8 V3:** “**Configuration.h**” file.

When the transport is ready measure the distance compared to the 20 mm mark.

If you are above the 20 mm mark (less than 100

mm feed) raise the E step value

If you are below the 20 mm mark (more than

100 mm feed) lower the E step value Regular E step value for a 0.4 mm nozzle is between 865 to 935.

**As of RC8 V3.2:** “**Configuration_xxxx.h**” file, see **Section 11.1.3**.

In the line: #define DEFAULT_AXIS_STEPS_PER_UNIT {160,160,3200,935}

change last value and upload the new value as firmware to the machine.

Or use the LCD control panel and go to:

1) &gt;control&gt;motion&gt;E-Steps/mm and adjust the value required (press the knob to accept new value).

2) &gt;control&gt;store memory (press knob to save values to EEPROM)

Or you can send G-code commands from Pronterface or other utility:

1) M92 X?? Y?? Z?? E??. Fill in the value you like to be used at the question marks.

2) M500\. To finish the sequence. This saves the values in the EEPROM.

Remove the drinking straw when ready. 

**11.6 Pin Assignment – MKS Gen V1.3/V1.4**

If your MKS Gen V 1.3 or V 1.4 board has problems with certain outputs or inputs, we can use the free available connections and change the pin assignments of the appropriate headers.

The MKS-Gen V1.3/V1.4 is equipped with only one free output screw-terminal, called **H1** as depicted in the picture below.

The MKS-Gen V1.3/V1.4 is also equipped with only one free input, 2-pin JST-XH connector, called **T1** as depicted in the picture below.

**Please note**

**The pin assignments shown in the following sections are only valid for the Marlin RC8 V3 FW. Line numbers in the following pictures are as follows: RC8 V3: “Configuration_adv.h” file. As of RC8 V3.2: “Configuration_adv_xxxx.h” file, see Section 11.1.3\. For Marlin RC8 V3.2 and up, click “Ctrl+F” to find the strings.**

**Please note**

**Lower Marlin RC8 versions are not supported by the section.suite, which is about to discontinue at the beginning of 2017.**

**11.6.1 Heat-bed Heater**

There is **only one** high-current (20A) output screw-terminal on the controller board, labeled

“Bed”, which is suitable for the heat-bed heater.

Therefore if it is faulty, you **can’t directly drive** the heat-bed using any other low-current (10A)

output screw-terminal, as shown in the 1st picture.

However, you **can indirectly control** the heat-bed, by using either an External Heatbed Driver (external MOSFET), as shown in the 2nd picture, or an SSR (not shown), controlled by the H1 Low- current (10A) output screw-terminal.

**Please note**

**The following pictures are in hi-res. In the PDF document, you should zoom to 200%-300% in order to see the fine details.**

Re-routing the heat-bed heater control, from the “**Bed**” connection to the “**H1**” connection:

**Please note**

**1) As depicted by the legend, the dotted line represents the FAULTY default connection. The solid line represents an ALTERNATE connection. The table shows the default and alternate header names and pin assignments.**

**2) External Heatbed Driver (external MOSFET) is shown in the picture. If your setup is fitted with an SSR (not shown), dotted and s ol i d li nes fr om the SSR’ s c ontr ol i nput to the MKS -Gen terminals are the same. Detailed picture with an SSR can be found in Section 7.10.7 of this**

**guide.**

**11.6.2 Part/Layer Cooling Fan**

The stock BW is equipped with 40mm heat-sink fan, which cools the hot-end’s heat-sink, and is connected permanently to 24VDC via connectored cable running through the drag-chain. **This heat-sink fan must be running as long as there is power to the BW**.

If you like to cool the object you need to add a part/layer fan near the nozzle. This layer fan and its mounting/duct are not standard and need to be made separately. You can find appropriate solutions in section 4.7.

For the layer fan you need to add wires into the drag chain.

The wires, in correct polarity, should be connected to the green screw terminal on the MKS-Gen v1.3/ V1.4, that has the name “**Fan**”, see the following picture for the **default** connection.

If this connection is not working for any reason, then follow the **alternate** connection to the “**H1**”

screw terminal, and re-assign the FW pins, as shown in the following picture. The layer fan port can be controlled through either of the following:

 Machine LCD.

 Slicer code.

 Control program like Repetier.

 G-code commands.

The G-code command to control the layer fan speed from 0 to 100% is M106 Sxxx, whereas

“xxx” is the PWM value (0-255), and whereas the zero value (S0) turn off the fan.

Re-routing the layer fan control, from the “**Fan**” connection to the “**H1**” connection:

**11.7 Babystep &amp; Live Adjust (Revised section)**

As of Marlin RC8 V3.2 FW for the BW, the main menu structure has an added function during a print called “Live adjust Z” when using ABL. For a Non-ABL operation, the function remains &quot;Babystep Z&quot;. When in idle mode these functions are not available.

When do you use these functions?

If you start a print job, that for example contains a skirt around the object, and while printing this layer you notice that the layer height is incorrect, then you can use either the “**Babystep Z**” or “**Live adjust Z**” function to correct it **on the fly**, as shown in the following table.

**12.2 Slicer**

**12.2.1 Cura (Freeware)**

TEVO machines do not come with any driver/slicer or other machine related software supplied. For slicing (**preparing a file and printing a *.stl file**) you can use Cura which is developed by Ultimaker, and has several versions available. Version 15.04.6 is the last non-beta version of the

1st generation of Cura. This is full function free software with full slicing and printing capabilities

through USB. Use this as standard slicing software for the first prints you make.

**If you are an experienced user, you may use the 2nd generation of Cura, the Cura 2.X versions, which are more advanced than the 1st generation with additional features. However if you are a newbie, do not use any of the Beta versions, as these are intended for experienced users.**

The following link is for all Cura versions: [**https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software/list**](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software/list)

The following paragraphs will add detailed information regarding the two generations.

**1st generation: Cura 15.4.6**

For starters we advise to use the 15.4.6 version.

You can also print using this version by USB (printing by USB is not advised for long prints). For long prints save your G-code file to a SD card and print from there.

If the printer is not recognized by CURA the print function option is not available and only the

SAVE icon is shown.

If the printer is recognized by CURA the print function option is shown.

To make the print function available you have to set the com-port and baud rate manually. In the machines setting screen select the correct com-port and baud rate from the Communications settings drop-down menu’s.

Com-port (Serial-Port) &gt; select the correct com-port **not** AUTO Baud-rate &gt; 250000

As option is shown. Also add the Maximum settings for width, depth and height values.

Some starter filament settings for CURA 15.x.x for the Black Widow can be downloaded.

They are the profiles which you can import and start with tweaking them for the best result with

your own machine and filament. Take care they are general profiles and might give different results than others.

[**Sample PLA profile**](http://www.jupacreations.com/curaprofiles/PLA%20CG%20sample%20215_60.ini)

[**Sample PETG profile**](http://www.jupacreations.com/curaprofiles/PETG%20CG%20sample%20225-80.ini)

Below you see the two tabs, Basic and Advanced that carry the most settings you might like to change.

In the Expert tab there are some more settings but if you use one of the two sample profiles as starter you do need to change their things.

**2nd generation: Cura 2.3**

These versions have a new user interface and look, and can be used but still have some bugs. Some features are added but in general it does the same as the 15.4.6 version.

Problems reported are.

1] No detection of the com-port for printing by USB as this version use by standard auto port detection only which not always works.

2] BLT can have problems with correct Z height after G29

3] Imported profiles generated in the 15.4.6 version is due to give wrong settings.

4] Multiple objects can’t be split when loaded.

5] No easy start/end code script access.

**Cura 2.4 Beta2**

1] No detection of the com-port as this version use by default an auto port detection only.

2] BLT can have problems with correct Z height after G29

3] Imported profiles generated in the 15.4.6 version are due to give wrong settings. Cura auto com-port selection problem solution…………….

**12.2.2 Slic3R (Freeware)**

Slic3r is another freeware slicer, which some experts claim that is better than Cura.

The SW &amp; manual can be found here: [**http://slic3r.org/**](http://slic3r.org/)

**12.2.3 Simplify3D**

Simplify3D, or S3D in short, is a paid for slicer. It is considered by most experts to be the best

slicer, and can be purchased for 149USD here: [**https://www.simplify3d.com/**](https://www.simplify3d.com/)

**12.3 Design**

**12.3.1 Tinkercad (Freeware)**

For designing simple 3D objects you can use Autodesk’s Tinkercad. This is a free full function online software, which can be found here: [**https://www.tinkercad.com**](https://www.tinkercad.com/)

**12.3.2 123D App Suite (Freeware)**

If you would like to design offline, a good free package is the Autodesk’s 123D design suite which

consists of several standalone applications, which can be found here: [**http://www.123dapp.com/**](http://www.123dapp.com/)

The design package is 123D Design, which is part of this suite.

**Please note**

**This suite is about to discontinue at the beginning of 2017.**

**12.3.3 Netfabb**

Netfabb is a paid application (3-years free for students). It is considered to be one of the best apps for checking and repairing your STL files, prior to sending them to the printer, which can be

found here: [**https://www.netfabb.com/**](https://www.netfabb.com/)

**It is a good practice, and highly recommended, to repair each STL file prior to sending it to the slicer, even if the file is coming from a known good source. There are many defects which seem legitimate to the slicer, and you will probably find them when the print is done.**

**12.4 Control**

**Please note**

**The Extruder (E0) motor can only be tested if the hot-end is above 170 degrees Celsius. This is to prevent grinding of the filament when the heater is not warm enough to melt the filament.**

To control the machines XY and Z axes, both of the following programs can be used.

**If you need to set a baud rate use AUTO or select 250,000 for any PC related communication.**

**12.4.1 Repetier-Host (Open Source)**

[**Repetier-host** (](https://www.repetier.com/download-software/)can slice by itself as stand alone, or slice in conjunction with multiple other slicers)

**12.4.2 Pronterface (Open Source)**

**13.2 BW Square &amp; Parallel Rev – 1.0 by Doron Shalev**

**13.2.1 Proper disclosure**

I was TEVO’s beta tester for the Black Widow 3D printer; however TEVO has neither approved nor endorsed this document.

Therefore following this document is on your own responsibility and risk.

**13.2.2 Acknowledgments**

I would like to thank Bruce Walker, Laurent Paillard &amp; Jari Tulilahti, for their help in reviewing, proofing and providing constructive comments which are embedded in this document.

**13.2.3 Introduction**

This is one of the most important procedures a BW builder would face in order to assure high quality prints.

Hereinafter, the assembly comprising the two 2040 extrusions and the small wheel carriages will

be called: “The X-Gantry”.

Each of the leadscrews is constrained at 3 points: The top and bottom bearings, and the ACME

nut, which is part of the X-Gantry. The X-Gantry has a fixed length during Z-travel. The two issues this procedure is dealing with are:

A) Any deviation of the leadscrews out of parallelism will cause them to bend along the travel of

the X-Gantry.

B) Any deviation of the ACME nut’s threaded hole from the straight line path, from the center of the bottom bearing to the center of the top bearing, will cause the leadscrew to bend as the ACME nut travels up and down the leadscrew.

The way of dealing with this issue is by transforming the 3-point constraint system into a 2-point constraint system. The bottom bearing serves as the pivot point of the straight line, and the ACME nut serves as the tuning point of the straight line. The top bearing hole, which has no bearing during the tuning process, serves as a reference point showing that the 3rd point on the straight line has arrived to the proper position, i.e. centered in the hole.

**Please note**

**Throughout this document, extrusions will be identified by their overall cross section dimensions, i.e. 2040 is 20mm by 40mm, 2080 is 20mm by 80mm, and 4080 is 40mm by 80 mm. The 4080 extrusions are also called C-Beams, as their cross section shape resembles the letter “C”.**

**13.2.4 Personal note**

I do believe that this C-Beam Dual-Z system has great potential which can be realized only if adjusted properly.

I also do realize that the following procedure is tedious, and some folks would like to take shortcuts. However until an Oldham Coupler for the BW will be available, an almost perfectly square and parallel printer is a must for best results.

Such a coupler is currently under development and would render this procedure obsolete in most cases.

**Doron Shalev**

**Nov-2016**

**13.2.5 Procedure Steps**

**13.2.5.1 Step-01: Initial assembly-1**

Assemble the small wheel carriages as per Fig. 1-1a &amp; 1-1b. Make sure your small wheel carriages are running smoothly on the 4080 C-beams, **without** any wobble or bumping.

**Please note:**

**The figure shows the stack-up of the wheel as per the manual. You may use a different stack- up in order to prevent wheel lock up and “sand” feeling, as well as to prevent possible scratching of the C-Beams. This may result in different dimensions, however the following procedure will take care of that.**

Hereinafter, the figures will show the stock stack-up only.

**13.2.5.2 Step-02: Initial assembly-2**

Assemble the frame and the X-Gantry as per Fig. 2-1 or 2-2\. **Use no shims** between the two 2040 extrusions, and the small wheel carriages. Make sure the X-Gantry is running smoothly on the

4080 C-beams, **without** any stops and/or bumping.

**Please note**

**You may be using the stock L-brackets as shown in Detail 2-1a, or cast corner brackets as shown in Detail 2-2a, which is recommended for long term stability of the frame.**

**Unless the procedure is different, hereinafter the figures will show the cast corner bracket version only.**

**13.2.5.3 Step-03: Leadscrew initial inspection**

Ensure your leadscrews are not bent by rolling them on a flat surface. If there is significant wobble, straighten or replace the leadscrews.

During the procedure and after assembling the leadscrews, you’ll be referred to the appendix

for leadscrew final inspection.

**13.2.5.4 Step-04: Determine the shape of your frame**

Ideally, the end to end distance of the two vertical 4080 C-beams should be X1; regardless the position of the X-Gantry, as shown in figures 3-1 through 3-3.

In practice, due to changes in the small wheel assembly stack, and manufacturing tolerances, there are variations on the X1 &amp; X2 lengths.

When the X-Gantry is at the lowest position, the frame may look diverging at the top, as shown

in figures 4-1 &amp; 4-2, or may look converging at the top, as shown in figures 5-1 &amp; 5-2.

A mere 1mm at the bottom, can manifest as 5mm at the top due to the height of the frame and the angles involved.

Divergence may be caused by the following scenarios:

a. 2040 extrusions of the X-Gantry are **longer** than necessary. In this case Δ2=+1mm, and

Δ1=+5mm as shown in Fig. 4-1.

b. Lower 2080 extrusions are **shorter** than necessary. In this case -Δ2=-1mm, and Δ1=+5mm as shown in Fig. 4-2.

Convergence may be caused by the following scenarios:

a. 2040 extrusions of the X-Gantry are **shorter** than necessary. In this case -Δ2=-1mm, and

-Δ1=-5mm as shown in Fig. 5-1.

b. Lower 2080 extrusions are **longer** than necessary. In this case Δ2=+1mm, and -Δ1=-5mm as shown in Fig. 5-2.

**Please note**

**The Δ sign means “Delta”, which denotes the difference between 2 quantities. Hereinafter it will denote the difference between 2 dimensions.**

**Please note**

**Divergence and convergence angles have been exaggerated in the figures to enhance clarity.**

**Please note**

**There may be combinations of the above (a) &amp; (b) scenarios, i.e. either both are shorter, or both are longer. The final result may be either divergence or convergence, which will determine the corrective action in this procedure.**

**13.2.5.5 Step-05: Divergence corrective action**

Add a shim between each of the 2080 &amp; the 4080 extrusions.

If your initial frame looks like figures 4-1 or 4-2, then after inserting the shim it should look like figures 6-1 or 6-2 respectively.

If you are using the stock L-brackets, the shim goes into the gap between the 2080 and 4080 extrusions as shown in Detail-1 Option-a of figures 6-1 &amp; 6-2.

If you are using a casted corner brackets, the shim would be a large washer, between the bracket and the 4080 extrusion, as shown in Detail-1 Option-b of figures 6-1 &amp; 6-2, which will leave a gap between the 2080 &amp; 4080 extrusions.

**Please note**

**Δ2 should be determined from Fig. 4-1 or Fig. 4-2, according to your case, according to the**

**following formula: Δ2≈Δ1/5.**

**Please note**

**Make sure that the end to end distance at the top of the 4080 extrusions remains constant throughout the travel of the X-Gantry.**

**It should be X1+ Δ2 if your case is per figures 4-1 &amp; 6-1.**

**It should be X1 if your case is per figures 4-2 &amp; 6-2.**

**Please note**

**If the gap width Δ2 does not correspond to a shim that you have on hand, you may “lock the gap” using only the brackets. There is at least one BW printer assembled this way with the cast corner brackets. I am not sure that this is feasible with the stock L-brackets, however you may try.**

**13.2.5.6 Step-06: Convergence corrective action**

Add shim between each of the 2040 extrusions, and small wheel carriage, of the X-Gantry.

If your initial frame looks like figures 5-1 or 5-2, then after inserting the shim it should look like figures 7-1 or 7-2 respectively.

The shim would be a large washer as shown in Detail-1 of figures 7-1 &amp; 7-2.

**Please note**

**Δ2 should be determined from Fig. 5-1 or Fig. 5-2, according to your case, according to the**

**following formula: Δ2≈Δ1/5.**

**Please note**

**Make sure that the end to end distance at the top of the 4080 extrusions remains constant throughout the travel of the X-Gantry.**

**It should be X1 if your case is per figures 5-1 &amp; 7-1.**

**It should be X1+ Δ2 if your case is per figures 5-2 &amp; 7-2.**

**13.2.5.7 Step-07: Verify the frame**

Temporarily assemble the top 2080 extrusion.

Watch the gap between the top 2080 extrusion and the 4080 C-Beam.

**You should verify that the top 2080 extrusion does not deform the frame!**

**There are 3 possible scenarios: A) There is a positive gap.**

Prepare shims with width equal to the gap, to be assembled at the **top joint**, similarly to what

you have done for the lower joint in Step-05.

In this case your final frame would have **two** places with shims. At the bottom joint, and at the top joint.

**B) There is a zero gap.**

You are lucky. Go to Step-08.

In this case your final frame would have **one** place with shims. At either the bottom joint, or at the X-Gantry.

**C) There is a negative gap**, i.e. the top 2080 extrusion is pushing on the 4080 C-Beams.

Prepare shims with width equal to the gap, to be assembled at **both** the **bottom joint**, similarly to what you have done in Step-05, **and** at the **X-Gantry** similarly to what you have done in Step-

06.

This would be equivalent to scenario (B) i.e. zero gap, however in this case your final frame would have **two** places with shims. At the bottom joint, and at the X-Gantry.

**Please note**

**In scenario (C), due to real world constrains you may only find standard shims that would give you combinations that would lead to scenario (A) rather than (B), i.e. positive gap rather than zero gap.**

**In this case your final frame would have Three places with shims. At the bottom joint, at the**

**X-Gantry, and at the top joint.**

**13.2.5.8 Step-08: Measure the gap between the leadscrew and the small wheel carriage**

Now that the 4080 C-beams are parallel, it’s time to measure the gap between the leadscrew

and the small wheel plate, as shown in Fig. 8-1.

Assemble the leadscrews and install bearings and collars at **both** the top &amp; bottom end plates, as shown in Fig. 8-1, Details-1&amp;3.

**The ACME nut is not installed**, as shown in Fig. 8-1 Detail-2, in order to maintain a 2-point constraint system, and determine the position of the leadscrew relative to the small wheel carriage.

The gap X3, should be constant at 5.4 mm nominal, throughout the X-Gantry travel.

**If it is not, there are 2 possible causes: A) The leadscrew is bent/crooked.** Please refer to Step-03.

**B) The leadscrew is not parallel to the 4080 C-beam.**

Please continue with this procedure.

To determine which case you are dealing with, please refer to the Appendix.

**Please note**

**Fig. 8-2 is the same as Fig. 8-1, whereas the 4080 C-Beam extrusion is hidden to enhance clarity.**

**Please note**

**This step should be done for each leadscrew independently.**

**13.2.5.9 Step-09: Parallel the leadscrews in the X-Z plane**

The previous steps ensured that the 4080 C-Beam extrusions are parallel. Therefore in order to ensure that both leadscrews are parallel, each of them should be parallel to its corresponding

4080 C-Beam extrusion.

Assemble the X-Gantry, the leadscrews, the ACME nut, the collars and the **bottom only bearing**, as shown in Fig. 9-1 and associated side-view details.

**The top bearing is not installed**, in order to maintain a 2-point constraint system, and determine the position of the leadscrew relative to the hole of the top bearing.

The X-Gantry should be at the **lowest position**, to enhance the sensitivity of the adjustment. Per the gap measured in the previous step (Step-08), and the dimensions of the POM/Brass

ACME (POM: Poly-Oxy-Methylene) nut supplied with your kit, you can determine the needed

spacer width between the ACME nut and the small wheel plate: POM ACME nut: **Spacer=Gap (mm)**.

Brass ACME nut: **Spacer=Gap-3.5 (mm).**

**The leadscrew should remain centered within +/- 0.1 mm inside the top bearing hole, relative to the X direction, during the whole travel of the X-Gantry.**

**Please note**

**The 4080 C-Beam extrusion is hidden in the figures to enhance clarity.**

**Please note**

**If your actual gap is less than the width of the supplied spacer, you may sand down the supplied spacer 0.05 mm at a time, until the top of the leadscrew is at dead-center relative to the top bearing hole. Remember that each 0.05 mm at the X-Gantry when it is at the lowest position, manifests as 0.25 mm at the top.**

**If your actual gap is greater than the width of the supplied spacer, or if you are using the Brass ACME nut, you may need to use combinations of shims in order to get to your target spacer width.**

**Please note**

**This step should be done for each leadscrew independently.**

**13.2.5.10 Step-10: Parallel the leadscrews in the Y-Z plane**

Release to POM/Brass ACME nut locking screws and adjust the ACME nut **until the leadscrew is centered, within +/- 0.1 mm, inside the top bearing hole**, as shown in Fig. 10-1, Details-1&amp;2.

The amount of “play” between the ACME nut and the screws is in the order of +/- 0.1 mm, which will result in +/- 0.5 mm movement of the leadscrew relative to the top bearing hole.

**The leadscrew should remain centered within +/- 0.1 mm inside the top bearing hole, during the whole travel of the X-Gantry.**

**Please note**

**If you are using the supplied POM ACME nut, you may make this adjustment while the X- Gantry is assembled on the 4080 C-beams. The Nylock nuts inside the recesses of the POM ACME nut will “hold” the screws even when not tightened.**

**Please note**

**This step should be done for each leadscrew independently.**

**13.2.5.11 Step-11: Finish**

At this stage both leadscrews should be centered relative to their respective bearing holes, and this should hold true throughout the travel of the X-Gantry.

You may continue with the build instructions as per the manual.

**13.2.6 Appendix**

**13.2.6.1 Leadscrew final inspection**

Assemble the X-Gantry, the leadscrews, the ACME nut, the collars and the **bottom only bearing**, as shown in Fig. A1-1 and associated side-view details.

The X-Gantry should be at the **lowest position**, to enhance the sensitivity of the test.

**The top bearing is not installed**, in order to maintain a 2-point constraint system, and determine the position of the leadscrew relative to the hole of the top bearing.

Rotate the leadscrew **one turn**, using your fingers, and observe the trace the top of the leadscrew is making inside the top bearing hole.

**There are 2 possible scenarios:**

**A) Leadscrew bent/crooked.**

The leadscrew wobbles throughout this rotation, as shown in Fig. A1-1, Detail-1a.

**B) Leadscrew not parallel to the frame**.

The leadscrew end remains at the same position, throughout this rotation, as shown in Fig. A1-1, Detail-1b through Detail-1d.

It doesn’t matter where the tip of the leadscrew is at the beginning of the rotation. What

matters is that the tip of the leadscrew remains at the **same point** throughout the full rotation. The leadscrew is straight, however slanted relative to either the X-Z plane, or the Y-Z plane, or both.

**Please note**

**The 4080 C-Beam extrusion is hidden in the figures to enhance clarity.**

**Please note**

**This inspection should be done for each leadscrew independently.**

**13.3 Heat-bed ABL Instructions**

**13.3.1 ABL-General**

This annex is based off the “**Tevo Tarantula Auto Level Instructions**” document by **Ed Farias**

(ArcadEd), and adapted for the Black Widow Community Guide by **Doron Shalev**.

Proximity sensors are devices which can detect an object at a predetermined distance. There are many types of these which include Inductive, Capacitive, Magnetic &amp; Optical. We will

concentrate on the Inductive type which can detect metallic objects, and the Capacitive type which can detect non-metallic objects, which are the common types in 3D printing.

The operation principles of these are outside the scope of this guide, and the interested reader is referred to the public domain literature.

These sensors function like mechanical switches and therefore classified as either NC (Normally Closed), or NO (Normally Opened) switches. However since they are implemented electronically, they are also having either a PNP, or an NPN transistor at the output.

Good engineering practice requires that the end-stop circuit would be NC during normal operation, and open when homing or reaching the end-travel. Thus if the switch malfunctions/disconnects, the heat-bed/hot-end would not move, rather than crashing into the end-stop which is the case with NO end-stops. The Marlin FW default is therefore set for NC switches. However TEVO has decided to use end-stops with NO mechanical switches for the Tarantula, and followed with end-stops having Inductive NO/NPN sensors for the BW.

We can’t cover all four combinations of sensor output configurations, and will follow the TEVO

BW stock, which is the Inductive type GL-8H sensor employing the NO/NPN configuration.

**Please note**

**If you are having either NO/PNP, or NC/NPN or NC/PNP sensor, the following sections WOULD NOT apply. You would need to figure out the proper connection configuration and/or change the FW.**

**Please note**

**Official FW version, RC8 Vx.x-PROX where x.x is 3.2 and up, which is suitable for the sensors discussed in this annex, is currently available. Please refer to Section 11.1.3\. If you wish to use an earlier version, you can manually configure the FW, as explained in Section 13.3.4 ABL-FW**

The following table summarizes the more common sensor types, which have community mountings, as well as FW support.

**Please note**

**The detection range of these sensors is rated from an Iron plate. Since the heat-bed is usually made of Aluminum, and in some installations there are an additional glass and/or other covers, the actual detection range is usually much smaller, and each installation should be checked for compatibility.**

**For Inductive type over Aluminum, the sensing distances should be multiplied by 0.4 (40%).**

**13.3.2 ABL-Mounting**

**Please note**

**Regarding the LJ(C)-series, the following mountings include adaptors ONLY for the 18mm diameter bodies. They DO NOT include adaptors for the 12mm diameter bodies. If you have a**

**12mm body sensor, you would need to design a proper mounting/adaptor.**

**We recommend using the 18mm versions, as for only 3mm “penalty” in position; you get more than double sensing area, which makes the reading more reliable.**

A Modular X Carriage which enables you to fit any extruder/hot-end/sensor combination.

[**http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1829292**](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1829292)

**Sensor offsets in FW, refer to Section 13.3.4:**

**Default: X: -40 ; Y: +10**

**Titan direct extruder +E3Dv6: X: -40 ; Y: +16**

You want the bottom of the sensor to be slightly higher than the tip of the nozzle, but not too much. 1-2mm is probably good. The goal here is for the sensor to detect the aluminum bed before the nozzle touches it.

**Please note**

**Capacitive sensors have better results with lower sensitivity. That is, you need to reduce the sensitivity so that the trigger point will be as close to the glass plate as possible. In repeatability tests, both the Sigma, and Mean variation over 24 hours improves when you do that. Therefore it is recommended to adjust the sensitivity to 2mm max.**

Once the sensor is mounted you will want to remove you current Z end stop that is plugged in the Z- (Zmin) on the PCB, and replace it with the sensor plug, which you have outfitted per the figures below. The sensor will now become your Z end stop. Remember that the sensor can only detect metal in the Inductive case, or some other solid surface in the capacitive case, therefore if it’s off the side of the heat-bed when your Z is going down; there is nothing to stop your nozzle from crashing into your heat-bed and doing some damage to other parts.

**13.3.3 ABL-Connections**

As depicted in Section 13.3.1, these sensors are rated for 6-36VDC. Depending on the vendor, there are variants rated for 10-30VDC.

There is a lot of controversy in the 3DP community at large, regarding whether these sensors can operate off the regulated 5VDC, which is part of the 3-pin Z-end-stop header, or not.

The answer to this is not Black &amp; White, as some YouTubers claim, but rather in the Gray area, and is mainly dependent on the internal implementation of the sensor, which is usually vendor dependent.

Some vendors implement their sensors using discrete components, in order to lower the cost. These sensors would operate off the regulated 5V bus, and even perform well, as evidenced from the optional SN04-N Inductive sensor used on hundreds of TEVO Tarantula printers.

Other vendors implement their sensors using an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit), which usually contains an internal voltage regulator. These sensors would not operate off the regulated 5V bus, and the only option is to power them from the 12/24VDC bus. This would require some means to reduce the output voltage from 12/24V to 5V in order to prevent controller damage. There are 2 configurations given here for this purpose. One with resistive divider, and one with a switching diode, which is the recommended one, as it can be used “as is” for both 12V and 24V systems.

We would like to have a sensor with readings that are stable both short term and long term.

The long term stability is determined by the “mean” parameter of the repeatability test described in Section 13.3.6.4 . We would like this number to be within 0.1mm over days, in order to have a good 1st layer without re-calibrating the Z-offset too often.

The short term stability is determined by the “sigma”, aka standard deviation parameter of the repeatability test. We would like all measurements to be in an 0.1mm window in order that the mesh is calculated accurately for having a goo 1st layer across the bed. In the empirical sciences the so-called three-sigma rule of thumb expresses a conventional heuristic that &quot;nearly all&quot; values are taken to lie within three standard deviations of the mean, i.e. that it is empirically useful to treat 99.7% probability as &quot;near certainty&quot;. Therefore if sigma is better that 0.03mm, then 3-sigma is better than 0.1 mm.

The following table summarizes the results of a full week’s research on the subject. Once you have determined the sensor you actually have, you may follow our recommendations.

|  | **Sensor can operate 0ff 5V** | **Sensor cannot operate off 5V** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **How to tell** | 1) Sensor fed with 5V. | 1) Sensor fed with 5V. |
| **Sensor internal** | Discrete components. | ASIC |
| **Operation off** | 1) Trigger threshold: Soft (on-off | **N/A** |
| **Operation off** | 1) Trigger threshold: Hard (on-off | 1) Trigger threshold: Hard (on-off over |

**Notes regarding EMI filter &amp; immunity:**

1) Regulated 5V is confined to the board. Runs to the sensor in a bundled cable with the GND wire. EMI picked on the way having approximately the same magnitude and/or phase on each wire, therefore tends to cancel at the sensor’s interface circuitry.

2) 12/24V line runs to the sensor, in part of the way, separately from the GND wire. EMI picked on the way having different magnitude and/or phase on each wire, therefore not canceled at the sensor’s interface circuitry.

3) Sensor’s onboard ASIC regulator virtually eliminates the EMI picked on the way.

4) Recommended EMI filter is a “clip on” type, capable of housing 2.5 turns of the sensor cable.

**Please note**

**The ABL sensor is mutually exclusive with the stock Zmin end-stop sensor, therefore only one of them can be connected to the controller board, as depicted in the following figures. The ABL sensor will serve for BOTH ABL, and end-stop functionalities, as defined in the FW.**

Depending on the vendor, some sensors are equipped with internal pullup resistor, and some are configured as an open collector arrangement, in which the circuit relies on external pullup resistor to function. The way to verify this is by measuring the resistance between the Brown and Black lines. If it reads infinity, then it is an open collector arrangement. If it reads a finite value in the range of KOhms, this value should be used as per the figures. Also if you are using different PSUs to power the heat-bed and the controller, you should use the controller PSU voltage for the calculations.

**Caution**

**In the following figures, it is assumed that MKS-Gen board is used. This board has 4.7KOhm pullup resistors on all X/Y/Z min/max inputs.**

**If you are using another board with an ATMega 2560 controller, however does not have on- board pullup resistors, you MUST enable the ATMega 2560 internal pullup resistors by the FW. Up to RC8 V3: “Configuration.h” file. As of RC8 V3.2: “Configuration_PROX.h” file, see Section**

**11.1.3\. It should read: #define ENDSTOPPULLUPS (Un-commented). Search the string by**

**clicking “Ctrl+F”.**

The tables in the following figures provide the values for the four combinations of finite/infinite internal pullup, and 12V/24V PSU. If you are using a different PSU voltage, i.e. cranked-up your

12V or cranked-down your 24V for any reason, the general formula is:

**ROUT=5*RIN/(VPSU-5) Please note**

**For the ROUT resistor, you should use the closest standard value which is BELOW the calculated value. This would result in less than 5V, which is safe.**

**13.3.3.1 Default End-stop Configuration**

There is a lot of controversy, whether these sensors which are rated for 6-36VDC, can operate from the 5V regulated bus. This is highly dependent on the sensor’s vendor. The high quality sensors are built with a special integrated circuit, which contains an internal regulator for stable operation. These will probably not work off the 5V. However most of the clones are made with discrete components, and would probably work fine off the 5V.

The following figure illustrates the default end-stop configuration, using 5V. There are hundreds of TEVO Tarantulas, if not more, that are using the SN04-N Inductive sensor in this configuration, without any reported issues, as well as numerous LJ(C)18-series sensors.

If you want to be on the safe side, or the following configuration doesn’t work for your sensor, you can either use a sensor which was verified to operate at 5V [**HERE**,](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/M18-8mm-sensing-DC-5V-NPN-NO-LJ18A3-8-Z-BX-5V-cylinder-inductive-proximity-sensor/32719316657.html?spm=2114.13010208.99999999.264.ndrTBA) or use the alternate connections shown in the following figures.

**13.3.3.2 Alternate Connection-1: Output Resistive Divider**

The following figure illustrates two scenarios:

1) There is no internal pullup inside the sensor, i.e. it is configured as “open collector”. The sensor’s output signal line (Black) is pulled to 5V by the MKS-Gen controller’s pullup resistor.

2) There is pullup resistor inside the sensor. The ROUT resistor between the signal (Black line) and GND (Blue line), provide a resistive divider in conjunction with the internal pullup resistor, thus limiting the signal output to 4.5-5V.

**Caution**

**This configuration is highly sensitive to PSU voltage. If you are using neither 12V, nor 24V, you should use the general formula: ROUT=5*RIN/(VPSU-5).**

**13.3.3.3 Alternate Connection-2: Output Diode**

This configuration is using a switching diode to block the sensor’s high voltage. The end-stop is pulled up to 5V by the MKS-Gen pullup resistor, regardless of PSU voltage, or sensor’s output configuration.

**Caution**

**This configuration is highly sensitive to diode polarity. If you reverse the polarity as shown, high voltage will be injected into the 5V port of the MKS-Gen controller and destroy it.**

**13.3.4 ABL-FW (Revised section)**

The following table summarizes the needed changes in the “**Configuration.h**” file **up to RC8 V3**

**Non-BLT** FW.

**Red color** represents changed item in the specified line, before the change. **Green color**

represents the item after the change.

**Please note**

**As of RC8 V3.2, the ABL’s specific** “**Configuration_PROX.h” file of the PROX FW variant is**

**already pre-configured, see Section 11.1.3.**

**Please note**

**Use the latest FW, FW uploading instructions, USB drivers &amp; USB driver’s installation**

**instructions, as described in the appropriate sections of this guide.**

**Please note**

**Use your specific configuration limits for the “Travel limits after homing”.**

**Caution**

**Although the bug, which allowed probing outside the limits, has been fixed in RC8 V4, you may need to fine tune these limits to ensure that probing is allways on the bed. When first operating the ABL, be prepared to turn off the master switch, in case you observe that probing is attenmpted ouside the bed !**

**Please note**

**EEPROM behavior with regards to ABL is still under investigation. At this point the FW default is maintained.**

**13.3.5 ABL-SW**

In your slicer there should be a place to put in starting G-Code commands. Here you will put a

G28, followed by a G29.

**Please note**

**1) &quot;#define ENABLE_LEVELING_FADE_HEIGHT&quot; is enabled in Configuration_PROX.h. This is used by issuing the M-code command M420 Z&lt;height&gt;. If you are having vertical lines in your print due to mesh leveling correction this will help combat this. Using &quot;M420 Z2 for a 2mm fade height, for a fairly leveled heat-bed, has shown good results.**

**2) You have to make sure to put the M420 Z&lt;height&gt; command BEFORE the home all (G28)**

**and auto level (G29) commands.**

**13.3.5.1 Starting G-Code: S3D (Simplify3D)**

**13.3.5.2 Starting G-Code: Cura**

**13.3.6 ABL-Operation**

Now try a print. Obviously this first time the nozzle will probably be too high since you started with a Z probe offset of 0 in the firmware under the “@section probes” section. There are a few ways to get this perfect. One way is by changing the number in the firmware, re uploading and trying again.

Another way is using the slicer programs which sometimes have Z offset setting. This is nice

therefore you don’t have to keep uploading firmware to find the perfect value.

**13.3.6.1 Z-Offset: FW**

In “**Configuration_PROX.h**” file, you should change:

“#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER **0**” to

“#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER **-0.5**”, and then increase the negative number by -

0.1mm i.e. -0.6, -0.7, etc. until you get your perfect 1st layer.

**Please note**

**The Z-offsets in the FW are NEGATIVE.**

**13.3.6.2 Z-Offset: S3D**

You should start with a small negative value, e.g. -0.45 as shown in the following example, and then increase the negative number by -0.1mm i.e. -0.55, -0.65, etc. until you get your perfect 1st layer.

**Please note**

**1) The Z-offsets in S3D are NEGATIVE.**

**2) It is recommended that after the final value have been found, this value should be written in the FW, and the slicer reset to zero. Small changes due to different bed temperatures for different filaments should be set via the slicer&#039;s menu, as you have done before.**

**13.3.6.3 Z-Offset: Cura**

In Cura you can set the Z offset in the start G-Code section. This same idea should work for other slicers as well. The G92 is your offset command, therefore you can do something like G92

Z1.10, as shown in the following example, to create an offset of 1.1mm. Then increase the number by 0.1mm i.e. 1.20, 1.30, etc. until you get your perfect 1st layer.

**Please note**

**1) You have to make sure to put the G92 Z&lt;height&gt; command AFTER the home all (G28) and auto level (G29) commands.**

**2) The Z-offsets in Cura are POSITIVE.**

**3) It is recommended that after the final value have been found, this value should be written in the FW, and the slicer reset to zero. Small changes due to different bed temperatures for different filaments should be set via the slicer&#039;s menu, as you have done before.**

**13.3.6.4 Repeatability Test**

If you have enabled this feature in the FW, as explained in Section 13.3.4, The M-code for repeatability test is M48\. The following command should perform 50 tests at X=100, Y=100 and do pseudo-random move of the head between each test:

**M48 P50 X100 Y100 V2 E L2**

If you want the test repeated 10 times at the center of the bed, and have some more information use the following short command:

**M48 V3 E L2**

**Please note**

**V4 will give you the maximum information, however may clutter your screen.**

The standard deviation of this test (“sigma”) should be **BETTER THAN 0.03mm**.

If it doesn’t, then the sensor isn’t operating properly. Do the following in order to determine the root-cause:

1) If you are using an adjustable sensor type, try to increase/decrease the sensitivity, and repeat the test.

2) If you are using glass or other removable sheets over the heat-bed, remove them for the test, and repeat the test. If this helps, you need to use a higher detection range sensor.

3) If you are using the default end-stop connection, try using one of the two alternate connections, and repeat the test.

If all the above failed, and your standard deviation is still above 0.03mm, than your sensor is faulty.

**Please note**

**The test should be done when the heat-bed and hot-end are at their nominal temperatures, e.g. for PLA: 60C for the heat-bed &amp; 210C for the hot-end.**

**Please note**

**The test should be repeated after 24 hours. The “mean” parameter should be within 0.1 mm,**

**otherwise your 1st layer would be laid wrong.**

**13.3.7 ABL-Conclusion**

That’s it. You should have all tools and knowledge you need to get going with the auto leveling

feature of your Black Widow using the proximity sensor and the Marlin firmware.

**Good luck and happy printing!**
