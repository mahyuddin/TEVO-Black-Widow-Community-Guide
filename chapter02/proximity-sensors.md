## 2.4 XYZ Proximity Sensors Adjustment

The X Y and Z sensors are proximity inductive sensors which sense metal. To get them working properly adjust them at a very close distance (maximum 1mm) to the part that should activate it. The sensors have a small orange LED built-in. When the sensor is activated the orange LED is ON. You can use a tip of a screw driver to test the sensor for working.
