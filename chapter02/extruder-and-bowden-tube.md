## 2.6 E3D-V6 Hot-end & Bowden Tube Assembly
Assembly instructions can be found here: [http://wiki.e3d-online.com/wiki/E3D-v6_Assembly](http://wiki.e3d-online.com/wiki/E3D-v6_Assembly)

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Stock V3 Hot-end breakdown is as follows:</span>

<b style="color:green">A) Heat-sink: Modified E3D-V6.</b>
- The J-Head and the fins are the same as E3D-V6, however the thread for the heat-break is M6, not M7.

<b style="color:green">B) Heat-block: Modified E3D-V5.</b>
- Different dimensions. An E3D-V5 heat-block may not function properly, thermal-wise.

<b style="color:green">C) Heat-break: Modified E3D-V5.<b>
- Longer by 1mm.
- Actually for 3mm filament, fited with 3mm OD, 2mm ID PTFE liner (PTFE: Poly-TetraFluoro-Ethylene, known as Teflon).

<b style="color:green">D) Nozzle: Modified MK7.</b>
- The nozzle is not from the E3D family.

    <tr><br><br>It is recommend for anyone who has one of it’s components faulty, to do the following:<br><br>
    <ol>
<li>Get replacement parts from TEVO. Getting replacement parts from other vendors would be extremely difficult, if not impossible on one hand, and trying to use the originals/clones won’t work, as most probably they won’t fit, or not work properly thermal-wise.</li>
<li>Replace the TEVO Stock-V3 with either a genuine E3D-V6, or a good clone, as depicted in the following <b>Figures 3 & 4</b>.</li>    </ol></tr>

    <tr><br><br> One of the most common errors, when assembling the hot-end, which is the #1 cause for leaks and clogs, is the way the nozzle is assembled with relations to the heat-block and heat-break.<br><br>
The nozzle must be locked to the heat-break, not the heat-block, as depicted in <b>Figure 2</b> above.<br><br>
When locking the nozzle to the heat-block, a gap is formed between the nozzle and the heat-break. (<b style="color:green">The gap is exaggerated in the figure, to enhance readability</b>) This gap will let the high-pressure molten filament to flow between the threads, and will start leaking at the top of the heat-block. In some cases,depending on manufacturing tolerances, it may leak from the bottom of the heat-block as well.<br><br>
If the gap is large enough, the rapid temperature changes during retractions, will eventually cause it to clog.</tr>
