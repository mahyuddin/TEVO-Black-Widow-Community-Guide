# 2. Building Instructions and Videos

## 2.1 Video Links

There are excellent three set of BW build videos on YouTube. Each one of these is showing the build from a different perspective. <span style="color:green">It is strongly recommended that you watch all sets before starting to build your own</span>, and then follow one of them per your personal preference.

There is also an excellent series of videos, by Thomas Sanladerer, that each newbie should watch, as they explain the basics of 3d printing, and apply to any printer. These can be seen at [Tomâ€™s Guides](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDJMid0lOOYnRCAdbFfzECor3EbqF8euw).

      <td style="text-align:left; width:50%">With your kit you receive two items as a gift. One item is a thermistor for the hot-end heatblock. <br><br><p style="color:green"> <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Please note</b><br> This thermistor can't be used on the heat-bed, as is, since the heat-bed uses an SMD (Surface Mount Device) type thermistor. If you need to use it for the heat-bed, refer to Section 10.2.3 for instructions.</p>The other item is two LED (Light Emitting Diode) strips which you can connect directly to the 24 VDC (Volt Direct Current) of the Power Supply Unit. If they do not work check the polarity. There have been reports that the polarity signs on the strip were wrong. So double check.</th></td>

## 2.4 XYZ Proximity Sensors Adjustment

The X Y and Z sensors are proximity inductive sensors which sense metal. To get them working properly adjust them at a very close distance (maximum 1mm) to the part that should activate it. The sensors have a small orange LED built-in. When the sensor is activated the orange LED is ON. You can use a tip of a screw driver to test the sensor for working.

      If you experience play on bearings, use the
following tip.<br><br>
Use regular thin paper and glue with a little bit of glue stick glue the piece to the outer race of the bearing and with care slide both in place. All depends on the play. When ready remove the paper remains not needed. If you experience such play you can use this trick temporary and file a support ticket at TEVO for a
correct version.<br><br>

Please note</b><br>
Some suffixes, e.g. ZZC have 5mm width. They
might fit, however this has not been verified.</p></td>

Assembly instructions can be found here: [http://wiki.e3d-online.com/wiki/E3D-v6_Assembly](http://wiki.e3d-online.com/wiki/E3D-v6_Assembly)

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Stock V3 Hot-end breakdown is as follows:</span>
<b style="color:green">A) Heat-sink: Modified E3D-V6.</b>
- The J-Head and the fins are the same as E3D-V6, however the thread for the heat-break is M6, not M7.<br>
<b style="color:green">B) Heat-block: Modified E3D-V5.</b>
- Different dimensions. An E3D-V5 heat-block may not function properly, thermal-wise.
C) Heat-break: Modified E3D-V5.
- Longer by 1mm.
- Actually for 3mm filament, fited with 3mm OD, 2mm ID PTFE liner (PTFE: Poly-TetraFluoro-Ethylene, known as Teflon).
D) Nozzle: Modified MK7.
- The nozzle is not from the E3D family.
