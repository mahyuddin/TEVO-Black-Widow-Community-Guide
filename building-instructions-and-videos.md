# Building Instructions and Videos

## Video Links

There are excellent three set of BW build videos on YouTube. Each one of these is showing the build from a different perspective. It is strongly recommended that you watch both sets before starting to build your own, and then follow one of them per your personal preference.

There is also an excellent series of videos, by Thomas Sanladerer, that each newbie should watch, as they explain the basics of 3d printing, and apply to any printer. These can be seen at Tomâ€™s Guides.
